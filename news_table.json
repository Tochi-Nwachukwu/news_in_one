{"id":"7","headline":"2023: PDP may counter Southern govs on zoning throw presidential ticket open","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/2023-pdp-may-counter-southern-govs-on-zoning-throw-presidential-ticket-open","stories":"As the clamour for the emergence of a southerner as the president in 2023 continues to generate comments there are indications that the main opposition party the Peoples Democratic Party may throw the contest open to all Nigerians irrespective of their zone. This comes days after southern state governors on Monday met in Lagos and agreed that the successor to the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) should come from the region. The 17 southern governors in attendance who belong to different political parties also deliberated on insecurity constitution amendment the Petroleum Industry Bill and anti-open grazing law in all member-states. Similarly members of the House of Representatives from the southern part of Nigeria adopted the resolutions by the Southern Governors’ Forum on the issues including the rotation of the presidency in 2023. The lawmakers said members of the House from the 17 southern states “unanimously and unequivocally endorse the patriotic resolution of the SGF on the resolve that the next president of Nigeria should emerge from the southern region.” However multiple sources among the members of the National Working Committee of the party told Saturday PUNCH that the decision to also zone would be left to the National Executive Committee of the party. The sources also explained that it would be too early to arrive at which zone would produce the party’s presidential standard-bearer now when the race had yet to be declared open. However they stated that it would be wrong for an opposition party to zone its tickets saying the party would have to look at some variables and other strategies that could make it win the election in 2023. They pointed out that of the 16 years the PDP was in power southerners were president for about 14 years. One of the sources noted that the PDP had to take many things into consideration the first being that the party was not in power. According to the PDP chieftain the party must therefore think about many things before giving out its ticket for 2023. The source said “Recall that we (the PDP) were in power for 16 years. Out of that 16 years former President Olusegun Obasanjo was in power for eight years. He handed over to President Umaru Yar’Adua in 2007. Unfortunately the former governor of Katsina State died in May 2010. “That was when his deputy Goodluck Jonathan was sworn in as president. Jonathan was re-elected president and was in power till 2015 when he was defeated by the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress Muhammadu Buhari. So you will see that the PDP has produced more southerners as presidents. “Let me also say that as sound as this argument is it is not the final say because the NEC would have to decide. But the fact still remains that no political party would want to field a weak candidate against a strong opponent and no political party would also want to marginalise other areas and concentrate power at a particular area.” The NWC member argued that no single zone could singlehandedly produce the president. “The North needs the South and the South also needs the North. You need to recall the number of years President Buhari had contested the presidential election before the southerners especially the South-West embraced him in 2015 and gave him their votes” the source said. Another top source stated that the southern governors needed to have gone to their political parties to convince them of the need to zone the ticket to the southern part of the country adding that their approach could be misinterpreted as ganging up against another zone. “I think the governors in the South should sell their idea to their colleagues from the North and then we will take it up from there” the source added. It was learnt that apart from a former Vice President Alhaji Atiku Abubakar Governor Aminu Tambuwal had also indicated to his close friends his desire to run for the presidency in 2023. Tambuwal a former Speaker of the House of Representatives was among other aspirants that were defeated by Atiku at the PDP convention in 2018. No southerner in the party has shown interest in the 2023 presidential race so far. Our correspondents gathered that a former Governor of Anambra State Mr Peter Obi who was a running mate to Atiku in 2019 had yet to indicate if he would run for president in 2023. It is also unclear whether the Governor of Rivers State Nyesom Wike will be throwing his hat into the ring. Wike was however a die-hard supporter of Tambuwal during the 2018 race for the presidential ticket of the PDP. “It will be difficult for us to impose candidates on the southern part of the country if there are no aspirants there who are willing to contest” another source stated. When contacted the National Publicity Secretary of the party Kola Ologbondiyan in a telephone interview said the party had yet to take a position on the issue of a possible southern presidential candidate in the 2023 election. Ologbondiyan said “Currently the party has not yet taken a position. But the conversation has started with our leaders. Usually that is how the conversation will start until it crystallises. As some of the leaders of the party are speaking a discussion has been opened in the public space but it is not yet before the party.” Meanwhile the Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress has decided not to speak on the contentious issue of zoning. It was also gathered that the party’s leadership had decided to leave the decision to the members of the party’s NWC to be elected at its national convention whose date has yet to be fixed. The Governor of Ondo State Mr Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) read the communiqué of the southern governors after their meeting. Akeredolu a member of the APC is the Chairman Southern Governors’ Forum. It was gathered that because the issue of rotation was believed to be sensitive the party’s leadership was being careful about how to handle it. The acting National Secretary of the party Senator John Akpanudoedehe told our correspondent that the caretaker committee was planning a national convention and that the issue of the rotational presidency was not part of the committee’s assignments. “We are planning a convention and the issue of the rotational presidency is not part of our mandate. Wait until after the convention” he said in response to an enquiry by our correspondent. In a related development the Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello has said the concept of the rotational presidency is no longer feasible because Nigerians are now yearning for visionary leadership more than ever before. He said even if the issue of zoning was being considered the North-Central region had been marginalised in the scheme of things. Bello spoke at the First Annual GYB Seminar in Abuja on Friday. He challenged proponents of rotational presidency to show the world which part of the Nigerian Constitution or the constitution of the APC supports rotation. Bello said “I have always asked this question there has been (power) rotation so to speak from the PDP almost all this while and what has been our result between then and now? If zoning will solve our problem as at the time President Olusegun Obasanjo was the president two times all the problems of the South should have been solved. “As of the time President Musa Yar’Adua of blessed memory came on board the whole problems of the North should have been solved.  Or when it returned back to the South-South the problem of the Riverine Niger Delta or of the whole of the South should have been solved. “Now we have President Muhammadu Buhari and it is expected that the problem of the North should have been solved.  I am not saying these various leaders have not tried their best. “They have tried their best within the circumstances they found themselves in the office or the situation of things at those times and what Mr President is doing today. For crying out loud he is at his best practice. “When we are talking of democracy it is about free choice. And it is about the number. Let the majority be allowed the free will to choose who they want. Let political parties not limit Nigerians to who they want to elect into offices. “When you look at it I think it is unconstitutional. Not in our own constitution — APC —­ and it is not there in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended. We cannot be picking and choosing when it suits us. A two-time member of the House of Representatives in Kogi State Sunday Karimi has said the North should produce the president in 2023. The lawmaker argued that the South had a total of 14 years in power while the North would complete 10 years in 2023. He added that for the sake of equity the next president should emerge from another geopolitical zone in the North “preferably the North-Central.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"8","headline":"Mass burial: Time running out for abandoned corpses of 99 children 25 adults at LUTH mortuary","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/mass-burial-time-running-out-for-abandoned-corpses-of-99-children-25-adults-at-luth-mortuary","stories":"124 corpses abandoned at LUTH mortuary risk mass burial unless relatives claim them on time Afeez Hanafi reports The fate of 124 corpses abandoned at the morgue of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital Idi-Araba Lagos is about to be sealed through a mass burial except their families claim the bodies early enough.  Of the number 99 were kids – aged 0 to 10 years treasured in birth and childhood but left to rot away in the mortuary after death. The sad reality is the lot of the dead children and 29 adult corpses whose families have refused to claim them for burial. Some have spent 18 months in the mortuary without any relations bothering about what had become of the remains. Rather than be given permanent resting places six feet below the earth the corpses daily constitute a burden to the facility that is supposed to be their temporary holding bay. Of late the pressing situation prompted the hospital management to decide on a mass burial for them. The management stated in a newspaper advertisement tagged ‘Unclaimed bodies from October 2019 to August 2020’ published on June 24 2021 stated “This is to inform members of the public whose deceased relatives were deposited in the mortuary of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital to come forward with necessary proof to collect the bodies within four weeks of this publication.” The notice signed by the Chief Medical Director Prof. Omolola Fakeye warned that the hospital would liaise with the appropriate government authorities immediately after the deadline to conduct mass burial for the unclaimed bodies “without further recourse to the families or relatives” urging the concerned relations to “take note.” “Within the time in question we have 29 unclaimed bodies of adults. We also have unclaimed 99 corpses of children – those between ages 0 and 10 years” a consultant pathologist at have LUTH’s Anatomical and Molecular Pathology Department Dr Martins Momoh told Saturday PUNCH. The mortuary charges fees for corpses of adults but retrieving children’s bodies is at no cost to the parents. Despite the waiver remains of babies keep piling up as families fail to show up. The bodies most of which Momoh said were dead newborns belonged to women referred to LUTH as a result of complications at traditional birth places. Oftentimes those patients were not booked at the hospital making it difficult for them to be traced in the event that the babies died the consultant said. “At times both the mother and the child died. Mainly the children’s corpses were products of unregistered pregnant women who gave birth to babies that were in a bad state and they (the babies) gave up. Many times they (mothers) just abandoned the children in the morgue” he said. Momoh lamented that LUTH had yet to see any relations or parents of those children noting that “most times the bodies were recovered at wards by mortuary attendants.” The mortuary supervisor Mr Christopher Adade said on many occasions parents owed hospital bills and in an attempt to avoid payment they would abandon their children’s corpses. He noted “Most of the unclaimed corpses were babies. Some of the parents believe that they don’t have anywhere to dispose of the bodies. It is a lot of stress but we do everything to make sure the morgue is not messed up.” Saturday PUNCH gathered that the majority of the unclaimed adult bodies were from accidents and emergencies. Momoh said that the corpses were usually victims of road traffic accidents brought in by concerned citizens and occasionally by policemen. Of the 29 bodies Momoh stated that the mortuary was able to establish contacts with only four relations meaning the bodies are no longer abandoned while families of the remaining 25 corpses never came. He stated “Sometimes they (the relations) give wrong phone numbers; we make efforts to contact them. The mortuary supervisor has been mandated to get in touch with them. Sometimes we call some phone numbers but the receivers will say ‘wrong numbers;’ sometimes the calls will not go through. “The predominant causes of deaths are multiple fractures occasioned by road traffic accidents gunshot wounds; trauma cases mainly. You hardly find those that died of chronic diseases such as diabetes and stroke as unclaimed corpses because they are brought in by relatives.” Disturbingly more than two weeks after the publication no families had contacted the morgue. Momoh said the department would continue to call the relations as the deadline draws near. He said “One of the corpses has no identity so there is absolutely no way we can trace it. For those that have names at one point the relatives came to the morgue for registration and stopped coming. The adults are mainly males but for the children we didn’t categorise them. Only one of the adults was aged about 70 years and we were in touch with the relatives. Others are young adults.’’ Upon the expiration of the deadline the hospital management would commence arrangements for mass burial of the corpses. However Momoh said any corpses whose relations showed up within time would be pulled out of the list and payment terms agreed upon. “So whatever we do we put a human face to it. But for those whose relatives have never shown up it is just an exercise in futility if we continue to keep them. We will give them mass burial” he added. Asked if there were cases in which families came to claim corpses after mass burial and took up the hospital the consultant responded in the negative saying he was not aware of any since 2006 when he joined the hospital. The morgue has 42 chambers each of which normally houses two bodies. Momoh complained that the preponderance of unclaimed corpses constrained the mortuary to put three in a chamber. “You can imagine the number of chambers occupied by the 128 unclaimed bodies” Momoh bemoaned noting that the morgue had to reject fresh bodies “even if the relatives are ready to pay.” He added “There is another morgue here that is a little more expensive and most people cannot afford it. It operates on PPP (public and private partnership) arrangement. That is why we need to discard those unclaimed corpses because the chambers are few. “However we have 56 new additional chambers that will soon be launched by the CMD so that we will be able to serve the public better. We receive five to 10 corpses every day excluding the COVID-19 period sometime last year when we did not receive any corpses.” Momoh further said the unclaimed bodies had negatively impacted on the department’s capacity to shore up its revenue. To resolve the crisis he said measures would be taken at the point of admitting emergency cases in the hospital. He stated “We will continue to do our best to enlighten people on unclaimed corpses. The enlightenment will come from the accident and emergency unit at the point of entry. Once a patient comes in they should be able to identify some responsible persons among the relatives that can be engaged. “Once patients die especially children the families feel the bodies are of no use. In preserving the body we have to embalm. Embalmment is N35000 per body. Then we preserve a body at a cost of N500 per day after the first 24 hours and the amount increases to N750 and N1000 as weeks go by.  So you can imagine the huge cost LUTH is bearing.” A sociologist at the University of Lagos Prof Olayiwola Olurode said was a high tendency that corpses of low-status persons would be abandoned in mortuaries as the cost of claiming the bodies might be an additional burden to their families. “Another reason is the cost of burial especially in Lagos” Olurode noted citing an instance whereby a family would spend at least N1m for mortuary bills coffin and burial in a cemetery. He added “The reason can also be connected with the circumstance of death. If the dead person was a vagabond or the family had wished him dead a long time ago they might not bother to claim his corpse. “In the case of child mortality whereby the mother also died the family might think that claiming their corpses is of no use. If it is only the child that dies the death of a child is something that is never wished. So the parents may feel discouraged to claim the corpse. There is also an attitudinal dimension to it. The living in this country are hardly respected not to talk of the dead.” The scholar opined that a poor database in Nigeria compounded challenges in tracking corpses whose relatives did not know their whereabouts. He stated “Every family should have the number of children they can take care of. Some people are just roaming about; they get missing and nobody bothers about them. We should also make burial as simple as possible instead of being elaborate. Some people abandon the corpses of their relatives for a year or two because they can’t afford the cost of burial.” Also a professor of psychology at the Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife Osun State Toba Elegbeleye said the reason people abandoned corpses especially in Lagos could be linked to limited space high cost of burial and economic hardship. Elegbeleye stated “To bury a child in a cemetery in Lagos comes with a cost. Many people will say what advantage is a child’s corpse to the parents though I agree we must honour the dead. People are economically incapacitated and when they are in that kind of situation they tend to resort to all kinds of shenanigans to escape unpleasantness. The hospital should have a watertight system in terms of how the patients are registered. “In a place like Lagos with all the associated population issues many people will not claim corpses. People pay through their nose to get their loved ones buried in some cemeteries in the state.” Also a lecturer at the Department of Psychology Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka Anambra State Prof Christian Nweke believed that single mothers would likely ignore corpses of their children particularly if the kids were products of unwanted pregnancies. “Also if the child is malformed at birth and later dies the parents may not bother to claim the corpse especially if the parents are of high status and do not want to identify with such a child” he added. In her view Lead Therapist and Chief Executive Officer Therapy Consult Bysalem Mrs Salem Ogunlowo noted that unclaimed corpses could be attributed to the emotional state of the families and their inability to deal with grief. She said “A mental health issue as well as loss of any kind can feel just as bad or worse as any other physical illness only that we cannot see it. The majority of individuals with mental health issues or challenges are as a result of unresolved grief. “For most of us we don’t know how to deal with losses so instead of grieving we fight the emotions deny it or act strong. Loss in whatever form it presents itself causes a pessimistic view of things. It also discourages enthusiasm and stifles one’s initiative. “As a psychotherapist and grief counsellor I know what it means to struggle with painful emotions. We all have things that are hard to deal with or process in life loss inclusive. Therefore we need people around us who will support us in dealing with them.” Ogunlowo said feelings arising from grief could be overwhelming and frightening noting bereavement is tough to deal with. She said “If you have ever suffered a loss of someone or something dear or of great value to you then you are familiar with the emotional pain cognitive distortion or behavioural pattern that comes with it. “One minute you are in disbelief restless agitated deeply sad depressed angry confused or numb. While the next minute you are crying panicking or feeling out of control due to the unfairness of the loss or losses. These reactions are called grief or mourning reactions. “Although they are the natural process on how we respond to loss or bereavement very few people know how to deal with it. The inability to resolve losses psychologically could result in complications like clinical depression and anxiety thereby affecting our general well-being or mental health. This could be one of the reasons why corpses are left or abandoned by relatives or parents.” Aside from accumulated mortuary bills high cost of burial in Lagos has been identified as a major reason families abandoned corpses in the morgue. In a recent report in Sunday PUNCH on public cemeteries in Lagos our correspondent who visited some cemeteries found out that burying the dead could indeed cost a fortune. For instance at Apena Cemetery on Herbert Macaulay Way the price ranges from N150000 for a single chamber vault to N350000 for a three-chamber vault. At Ikoyi Cemetery a single or double-chamber vault goes for N950000 while a three-chamber vault is N1050000. At Okesuna Cemetery on Lagos Island single and three-chamber vaults cost N150000 and N350000 respectively. Notably burying the dead could gulp millions of naira in some private cemeteries in Lagos. The ‘high costs’ constrained many poor relations to settle for temporary burial worth between N30000 and N100000 with the attendant risks including incidences of missing body parts associated with it. “A temporary grave is not a vault which is permanent. Any corpse buried in a temporary grave can be replaced after the body has decayed maybe a year after” a worker at one of the cemeteries had told our correspondent. According to Momoh LUTH has put in place arrangements to sort out hospital bills of those who died in the facility and is willing to give huge discounts on mortuary bills on compassionate grounds. He said despite the consideration and appeals by the management many of the families had yet to turn up. The consultant stated “We tell them there are arrangements available for them to ensure the recovery of the bodies. You may owe N1m or N2m all we are interested in is that the family should come to discuss with us. Once we discuss and give them some terms they can recover the bodies. “For instance someone that has abandoned a body for one year and owes N600000 may definitely not be able to pay due to the economic situation in the country. That has been factored in. They should just show up. We give huge discounts so that they can recover the bodies. The management will engage them and we have been magnanimous to quite a number of them. It had happened before and we were all happy about it. “Some people may owe N1m and the management will just tell them to pay N250000 which is about 75 per cent discount. Without discounts the bill for the unclaimed 29 corpses is up to N5m. Quite a number of the relatives owe the hospital other than mortuary bills. They owe bills as regards ICU (intensive care unit) blood transfusion drugs and admission. If they come the management will waive all those ones for them. The CMD has been kind enough to waive those bills.” Momoh stated that the impression by many people that LUTH was hostile and could detain hospital debtors was wrong saying that the management was always open to mutual engagement. He said “All you need to do is to engage the management. We will discuss slash the bill and even give terms. For example out of N600000 we may tell them to pay N200000 and out of it they may be asked to pay N50000 deposit and pay the remaining N150000 over a period of one year. It is a relaxed form of payment because we understand it is not a kind of payment the relatives are glad to make. “Perception of LUTH by the general public is that the hospital will not agree to terms and will compel them to pay everything and even detain them. But that is completely far from the truth. If they can’t approach the CMD they can approach the department and we will facilitate interaction with the CMD. He is even softer than most of us. They should feel free to come. “We empathise with them and whatever amount they owe the management knows how to make it easy for them. It is not good for our culture as Africans that bodies of our loved ones are being joined for mass burial. Those who lost their babies should come to retrieve the bodies.” Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"9","headline":"I love my body more after butt surgery –Nina Ivy","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/i-love-my-body-more-after-butt-surgery-nina-ivy","stories":"A former Big Brother Naija contestant and entrepreneur Nina Ivy has revealed that she feels very confident and loves her body more since she underwent a butt enlargement surgery. She told Saturday Beats “I have always wanted to make some changes to my body especially after the birth of my child and this was the perfect time. Since I made that decision I feel great and love my body more. I always had to wear body shapers with certain outfits but now I don’t have to. My advice to people who troll celebrities that undergo cosmetic surgery is that they should channel their energy into what will benefit them and let people live their lives.” Meanwhile Nina’s butt surgery had stirred controversy online as she had recently signed a contract with a natural body enhancement brand Mav Herbals yet still went ahead for surgery. The brand called her out on Instagram and requested for an apology and refund of the money spent on signing her as an ambassador. Speaking about the issue Nina said “Before signing the deal I had informed my then-manager Femi of Wynerz Talent that I was booked to undergo surgery. Femi came with the proposal from Mav Herbals and I had categorically told the company’s CEO that I was going for surgery. She (the CEO) agreed to still go ahead with the deal. “It was a surprise to find out that she made a post about me not working with her without speaking to me first about it and this happened before I began my ‘influencing’ with the hospital I had my surgery with. “This same contract was discussed with her and Femi. Meanwhile there is no clause in my contract that states that I cannot undergo surgery while representing her. “I have been a loyal and dedicated brand ambassador and influencer to numerous brands over the years. I have never had any issue with any of the brands I have worked with. The publications on different blogs and constant trolling made by her have caused defamation of my character and my legal team is on it.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The Benin Palace and the Edo State Government have been at loggerheads over where the artefacts will be housed. While the palace wants the artefacts kept in the Benin Royal Museum which will be built within the palace the state government wants the items preserved in the proposed Edo Museum of West African Arts. But Oba Ewuare II at a world press conference on Friday at the palace said that there was no controversy over the issue as an agreement had been reached that the artefacts would be housed in the royal museum. However a press release from the Government House also on Friday quoted Governor Godwin Obaseki as saying in Germany that a “transformational” museum would be built in Benin to house the artefacts upon their return as part of a new cultural district in the city. The artefacts were allegedly looted during the invasion of the Benin Kingdom in 1897 by the British led by Captain Philip. Speaking at his palace on Friday Oba Ewuare II insisted that the right and only legitimate destination of the about-to-be-repatriated artefacts was the Benin Royal Museum. He said “I have called this meeting today (Friday) to intimate you of the matter of the Benin artefacts in Europe on the verge of being repatriated which I am sure you have heard and read about in recent weeks. You may also have heard about the recent activities of a group of individuals who incorporated a company since January 2020 called Legacy Restoration Trust Limited. “It has become germane to note that the advocacy and demands for the return of the artefacts looted from the Benin Kingdom in 1897 have been going on for decades before the emergence of the incumbent Governor of Edo State Mr Godwin Obaseki. I must sincerely thank the governor for joining the struggle and showing commitment to retrieve our stolen cultural heritage from Europe. “While anticipating the return of the looted artefacts from Europe I want to note that attempts to divert the destination or the right of custody of the artefacts is not in the interest of the people of Benin Kingdom to whom the Palace of the Oba of Benin provides leadership. The looted artefacts awaiting repatriation from Europe are the cultural heritage of the Benin Kingdom created by our ancestors and forefathers within the traditional norms and rites of the kingdom. “They are not property of the state government or any private corporate entity that is not a creation of the Benin Kingdom. The right and only legitimate destination for the artefacts to be repatriated as already pronounced by my father is under the aegis of the Benin Royal Museum that will be sited within the precincts of the Palace of the Oba of Benin from where they were looted and also the proper traditional institution that is also the custodian of all the cultural heritage of the Benin Kingdom. “The palace therefore strongly advises that anyone group organisation or government – national and international – that is dealing with any organisation or artificial group in the process of returning the looted artefacts from the Benin Kingdom would be doing so at their own risk and against the will of the people of the Benin Kingdom.” Oba Ewuare II said he did not believe that the move by a privately registered company Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd and the purported establishment of Edo Museum of West African Arts were in consonance with the wishes of the people of Benin Kingdom adding that after his ascension to the throne he had several discussions with Obaseki on the plan for the Benin Royal Museum. The monarch said the governor expressed his readiness to work with the palace to actualise the wish of his late father adding that he had acquired additional plots of land from different families within the Adesogbe area near the palace for the purpose of building the Benin Royal Museum. The monarch said he was however surprised to read Obaseki’s letter to the palace wherein a new museum was being proposed and which would be funded and executed through the vehicle of Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd. He said “I informed him (Obaseki) that Oba Ewuare II Foundation had been registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission and had worked out a framework for not only receiving the artefacts but also building a modern structure – the Benin Royal Museum – within the precincts of the palace and that land has been secured for the building of the Benin Royal Museum under the supervision of the traditional institution. “But for reasons best known to him the governor has gone against the understanding given recent events. As a matter of fact the people of Benin Kingdom and other stakeholders especially the Benin Dialogue Group had at different meetings endorsed the Benin Royal Museum to be built within the palace as well as endorsing the Oba Ewuare II Foundation for fundraising and other requisite administration processes. “We wish to use this medium to call on the Federal Government to take custody of these artefacts on behalf of the palace until the Benin Royal Museum is ready for their collection. Under no circumstances should the custody of our age-old artefacts be handed to any privately contrived entity like Legacy Restoration Trust.” Oba Ewuare II advised Obaseki to review his approach of using the private vehicle of Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd and the Edo Museum of West African Art and see how he could “genuinely collaborate with the Oba’s palace in accordance with our original understanding. We thank the German government for its interest and willingness to return the Benin artefacts” the monarch said. “Perhaps there is a bridge or gap in communication not on our side but on the side of the state governor Obaseki who I insisted we should pray for. We need prayers for a peaceful resolution of these misunderstandings” Oba Ewuare II added. Meanwhile on Thursday the German Minister of State for Culture Prof Monika Grutters said the way the German government was dealing with the issue of Benin artefacts was important in addressing its colonial past. She gave an assurance that 1130 artefacts would be repatriated to Nigeria from the beginning of 2022 noting that Germany had twice sent delegations to Nigeria for talks over the planned repatriation. She said such a move indicated that both sides had moved beyond mere talks saying all the museums in Germany stockpiling Benin Bronzes had agreed to cooperate. The meeting in Berlin was attended by Grutters German Foreign Minister Mr Heiko Maas while the Nigerian delegation included the Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed and Obaseki. The Benin Royal Palace was represented by the Crown Prince of Benin Kingdom Prince Ezelekhae Ewuare. Mohammed proposed a one-year time limit for the full return of its artefacts from Germany. The minister according to a statement by his Special Assistant on Media Segun Adeyemi said the agreement for the repatriation of the Benin Bronzes from Germany must be signed by December 2021. “For us the most important issue in the roadmap is the signing of the agreement and the date of return. We won’t move forward if we don’t have a clear date on signing and return” Mohammed told participants at the meeting. “Full return should be completed in a year’s time not beyond August 2022” he added. The Secretary of State in the German President’s Office Stephen Steinlein was quoted as saying the German President was happy with the progress made so far on the planned repatriation of the artefacts. Obaseki told the participants that a museum was being built to make Benin City a cultural hub. The architect handling the museum project David Adjaye reportedly made a presentation to the participants during which he said the project would fuse the technology of ancient Benin Kingdom to that of the 21st century to get an organic pavilion that would boast an auditorium storage as well as exhibition space among other facilities. Other members of the Nigerian delegation included the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany Yusuf Tuggar; the Director General of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments Prof Abba Tijani; and the Director of the Board of Legacy Restoration Trust Phillip Ihenacho.

{"id":"21","headline":"Kaduna abduction: Baptist Church orders emergency prayer in over 100 countries","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/kaduna-abduction-baptist-church-orders-emergency-prayer-in-over-100-countries","stories":"Following the abduction of 121 students of Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State the Nigerian Baptist Convention said it had started organising prayers in all Baptist churches in Nigeria and abroad. The President Nigerian Baptist Convention Revd Israel Akanji said this in an interview with Saturday PUNCH on Friday which he said was the last day of the Baptist World Alliance. Akanji said the alliance comprised 127 countries of the world and that the event held via Zoom a virtual meeting platform. The clergy said at the event hosted by Brazil the 127 countries that make up the Baptist World Alliance were informed of the abduction of students of the Bethel Baptist High School. Asked what efforts the Baptist Church had made so far the clergy said “You know that we are a church and once we are in any difficulty the first point of call is to God in prayer. Therefore we have been organising prayer all over the Baptist Church in Nigeria and all over the world. “In terms of publicity (of the abduction) all over Nigeria it is known. Every state is aware and the Baptist World Alliance is also aware. “In fact Elijah Brown the General Secretary of the Baptist World Alliance has made a kind of press statement in which he spoke about the abduction of the students in Nigeria. He condemned this act that has been going on in Nigeria and especially the kidnapping of the students of our Baptist High School.” Despite the attack Akanji said the Baptist Church would not be intimidated noting that the Church would continue to provide quality education. According to him the Baptist Church has for the past 166 years operated secondary schools in Nigeria. He said “One thing we have been letting everybody know is that the Baptist denomination has given education to Nigeria since 1855. For 166 years now the Nigerian Baptist Convention has been providing education. “Our first institution is the Baptist Academy in Lagos which is still an institution to reckon with today and has produced great men and women for Nigeria. And the Baptist Boys High School in Abeokuta Ogun State produced Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and the late Chief MKO Abiola. These are people who greatly impacted Nigeria. “Now in our history this is the first time in 166 years that a Baptist school would be raided and the students kidnapped. It had never happened. So we believe in the strength of our history. By calling the Almighty God our students shall be returned to us.” “So we are thinking that having called on God and on our track record as a denomination providing education for this nation without ceasing for 166 years we deserve that our students should be brought back” he added. Akanji said he had spoken with the Kaduna State Governor Mallam Nasir El-Rufai who he said promised to do everything possible to secure the students’ release. Asked if the Baptist Church would engage Islamic cleric Sheikh Ahmad Gumi in leading mediation talks with the bandits to free the kidnapped students Akanji said the church would not stop parents from seeking Gumi’s help. He said “On the issue of talking to Sheikh Gumi well you know that when people are desperate  when people are in trouble because you are talking of a school where 121 students cannot be accounted for… These 121 students have parents and family members who are very concerned. “In fact some parents slept in the school compound praying all night that the children should be back. The parents can do what they like. And if they have been going round looking for one kind of assistance or the other we will not know the extent but as a church we have only been speaking to the government and insisting that the government should bring our children back because the security of lives is in the hands of the government. “I cannot stop anybody who goes to anybody to look for help because as I said these children have parents and we cannot stop them. They are at liberty to go wherever they want. But you are asking me as a church and I am saying that in our church we have not taken that decision that we are going to Gumi. We have not.” Students of the Bethel Baptist High School Kaduna were the latest victims of kidnapping in the Northwestern state. The victims mostly in Senior Secondary Schools 2 and 3 were kidnapped after bandits around 1 am on Monday invaded their school disguising as military personnel. A day after the kidnapping the bandits reportedly reached out to the school management demanding foodstuffs including 30 bags of rice 20 bags of beans and 10 kegs of palm oil to feed their captives. It was learnt that the students’ parents and school management had raised money to buy the foodstuffs following the bandits’ threats to starve the students if the foodstuffs were not supplied. The bandits have yet to demand any ransom. Meanwhile Kaduna State in recent times has become a hotbed of attacks on schools and kidnapping of students by criminal gangs called bandits. Bandits had in April kidnapped 29 students and two staff of Greenfield University at Kasarami Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Five of the students were later killed by the bandits while the rest were released on May 29. The incident came about six weeks after bandits on March 11 attacked the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation Afaka Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State and kidnapped 39 students. The students were released after about two months in the kidnappers’ den. The latest attack on Bethel Baptist High School has generated criticism on the inability of the government to secure the schools even as The PUNCH recently reported that no fewer than 348 students were still being held by bandits. Out of the 348 students three categories numbering 227 had been languishing in bandits’ dens many weeks after they were abducted from their schools in Niger Kebbi and Kaduna states. Parents of the Bethel Baptist High School Kaduna State held a four-hour prayer session on Friday to seek God’s face for their children’s release from bandits. In tears the parents converged on the school premises located along the Kaduna-Kachia Highway in Chikun Local Government Area of the state and asked God to take over the matter. The parents and sympathisers specifically prayed to God to touch the abductors’ hearts and release the 121 students in their custody unconditionally. Organised by the Kaduna Baptist Conference speakers at the event encouraged parents and the school management to remain strong and not lose hope during their trying period. The President Nigerian Baptist Convention Rev’d Israel Akanji said the church wouldn’t be intimidated over the attack on its school noting that the mission would continue to provide quality education for the country’s development – saying over the years the Baptist Church had been in the vanguard of providing eduction in Nigeria. He said “We don’t have security. Therefore I call on the Governor of Kaduna State [Mallam Nasir El-Rufai] to ensure that the students are released. When I spoke with him he made a promise and I’m trusting God that he will keep to his word in ensuring the students’ release. Also the Chairman Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria Rev’d John Hayab lamented the insecurity in the state. “We will not be intimidated. If the government was putting bandits on the run they would not have the mind to be asking for food” he said. The President Kaduna Baptist Conference who is also the Proprietor of the Bethel Baptist High School Rev’d Ishaya Jangado said Christians in the state were under pain. “Over 400 Christians have been kidnapped from January till date. We did everything the government asked us to do. They are sinking us into economic danger day by day” he said. In her brief remarks amid tears the school principal Mrs Florence Tuga urged mothers to pray and seek God’s intervention while touching their breasts and wombs. Meanwhile 42 persons have been Killed by bandits in five communities of Faru district in Maradun Local government area of Zamfara State on Thursday evening. The affected communities are Tsauni Gudan-Baushi Gidan-Adamu Wari and Gudan-Maidawa. An indigene of the area Mallam Buba Faru said the incident occurred on Thursday when the bandits who rode over 100 motorcycles stormed the communities. Buba said the bandits shot indiscriminately at the people burning their houses and food stores. He said “They were shooting indiscriminately at people they came across in the five communities. They also attacked farmers who were on their farmlands cultivating their crops. “So far 42 dead bodies have been recovered by the security and volunteer groups in the area.” The bodies according to Buba would be buried according to Islamic rites. Speaking to Saturday PUNCH on phone the spokesperson for the state police command SP Mohammed Shehu stated that 35 people were killed in the five communities. According to him their corpses were taken to Faru town for burial. Shehu stated that the police could not reach the affected communities on time when they were informed of the attack due to the road network. Also some bandits in separate attacks invaded Warkan village in Zango-Kataf Local Government Area and Kakkau village in the Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State killing 10 persons It was gathered that the bandits in the early hours of Friday invaded Warkan village in Zangon Kataf LGA killing nine persons and injuring others. Saturday PUNCH further learnt that the bandits in large numbers stormed the village around 2am while the villagers were deep asleep. The state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan on Friday confirmed the attack saying that the governor Malam Nasir El-Rufai had condemned the latest killings. Aruwan said “The Governor of Kaduna State Malam Nasir El-Rufai has condemned killings and disappearances of citizens in Zangon Kataf Igabi Chikun and Jema’a local government areas of the state. “The disappearance of five youths from Kafanchan town of Jema’a LGA was also reported today by the security agencies. The governor appealed to the affected families to remain calm as security agencies are investigating the incidents.” Meanwhile the President of the Students’ Union Government of the Federal College of Education Pankshin Plateau State Mr Zuma Fwanshiwa on Friday confirmed the kidnapping of a student at the college by gunmen. Saturday PUNCH gathered that the abducted student identified as Mr Felix Gele was in final year and operated a provision shop close to the institution. The spokesman for the state police command Ubah Ogaba when contacted promised to get back to our correspondent but he had yet to do so as of the time of filing this report. Meanwhile the Nigeria Customs Service says it has impounded an articulated vehicle loaded with diesel concealed in polythene bags meant for bandits in Katsina State. The NCS Controller in charge of the Federal Operations Unit Zone B Kaduna Albashir Hamisu made the disclosure in Katsina on Friday while handing over the vehicle to the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps for further investigation. Hamisu said the vehicle was intercepted and subsequently impounded on Wednesday. According to him each polythene bag contained 35 litres of diesel adding that the polythene bags were also concealed inside 200 sacks. The controller stated that the vehicle was intercepted along Batsari-Jibia road while heading towards a location around the Nigeria-Niger border. He added “The importance of this arrest is that banditry is being promoted by this kind of illicit activity. Every day bandits are on motorcycles and they don’t come to the filling stations to buy fuel.  The NSCDC Commandant in Katsina Mohammed Sanusi in his response promised an in-depth investigation. Meanwhile the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd) says the country has been under massive security threats in the last 12 years. Buhari however said his regime was more determined than ever to reverse the ugly trend through the promotion of national security and development. He identified threats challenging Nigeria as Boko Haram insurgency banditry militancy kidnapping and activities of separatists and armed militias among others. Buhari who was represented by the Minister of Defence Maj-Gen. Bashir Magashi (retd) on Friday stated this at the Armed Forces Command and Staff College Jaji near Kaduna State during the graduation of Senior Course 43 of the college. At least 226 officers of the Nigerian Armed Forces and those of eight other African countries were participants. He lauded the response of the Armed Forces of Nigeria to the Boko Haram insurgency banditry militancy kidnapping and others adding that the Federal Government would continue to provide the required guidance and support to ensure that the desired end state was achieved. The President said “Bear in mind that most security challenges facing the world today are both asymmetric and trans-border in nature involving mainly non-state actors in different sub-regions and regions. The West African sub-region and indeed our beloved continent of Africa are not immune to these threats.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The Controller-in-Charge of the command Mr Samuel Aguda who confirmed the development to journalists on Friday in Jos stated that the incident occurred in the small hours of Thursday. Attributing the development to negligence on the part of the personnel on duty he said “You are all aware of the ugly incident that happened in our major facility here in Jos. Yesterday around 1am four suspects who are awaiting trial over kidnapping and armed robbery escaped from our facility. “When I came to the scene I realised that it was either that they duplicated the key to the cell or there was serious negligence on the part of the personnel on duty. The inmates escaped through the fence.” Aguda said the service had commenced investigation to unravel the remote and immediate causes of the incident. “Currently the Assistant Controller General in charge of Operations is personally on the ground investigating the matter. “We have also constituted a search party who visited motor parks markets and other places in search of the escapees but none has been arrested yet. But I want to assure members of the public that we will soon get them” he assured. Aguda called on Plateau residents to avail the service information that could lead to the arrest of the escaped inmates. He also assured the public that any officer and personnel of the service found wanting in the incident would be punished. Aguda said the officers on duty on the day the incident occurred had been detained within the prison yard pending the conclusion of investigation.","image_links":"https:\/\/cdn.punchng.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/09235802\/Jos-inmates.jpg","news_authors":"Agency Report ","published_date":"Published 10 July 2021"},
{"id":"27","headline":"INEC job: Despite criticisms Senate panel set to recommend Onochie’s confirmation","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/inec-job-despite-criticisms-senate-panel-set-to-recommend-onochies-confirmation","stories":"There are strong indications on Friday that the Senate Committee on the Independent National Electoral Commission may recommend the confirmation of the appointment of a presidential aide Lauretta Onochie as a National Commissioner for the electoral umpire. The President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) had in a letter dated 12th October 2020 and read by the Senate President Ahmad Lawan the following week sought the Senate confirmation for Onochie and other nominees. The letter read “Pursuant to Paragraph 14 of Part I(F) of the Third Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended I hereby forward for confirmation by the Senate the appointment of the following four (4) Commissioners for the Independent National Electoral Commission.” The nominees listed by the President are Prof. Muhammad Sani Kallah (Katsina); Prof. Kunle Ajayi ( Ekiti); and Saidu  Ahmad (Jigawa) The red chamber suspended  action on the nominees based on the controversy it generated with the inclusion of Onochie the Special Assistant to the President on New Media who critics believed is a card-carrying member of the  All Progressives Congress. However Lawan on Wednesday June 9 2021 surprisingly asked the committee on INEC to screen for confirmation the appointments of Onochie and five others as INEC commissioners. Two new nominees Professors Sani Adam (North-Central) and Baba Bila (North-East) were added to the list. The development came eight months after the President sent the list of the nominees to the Senate for screening. The Senate INEC Committee led by Kabiru Gaya screened the nominees including Onochie on Thursday. Onochie in her opening remarks acknowledged a series of petitions against her which bothered on her membership of the APC and the fact that someone from her state was already on the board of INEC She renounced the party three times before the Senate committee. She admitted being part of the Buhari’s campaign organisation in 2015 before her appointment as Special Assistant on Social Media. Onochie also  admitted deposing an affidavit at the Abuja Federal High Court that she was a member of the  APC. She nevertheless said she stopped being a member of the party immediately after the 2019 elections. She said “Since 2019 I have not had anything to do with any political organisation including Buhari support groups. “When the APC was doing re-validation of party members I did not take part in that exercise. “As I’m sitting down here I’m not a member of any political party in this country. I have no partisanship in my blood. “I have seen many petitions against my nomination not only from the Peoples Democratic Party but also from some APC members. “I’m not partisan they know. It is about the law. No one has any reason to fear for my nomination as INEC commissioner representing Delta. “As far as I’m concerned I’m madam due process. That’s why all the attacks. I follow due process I follow the law.” However an affidavit dated 30th June 2021 she swore to at an FCT High Court attached to one of the petitions against her contradicted her claims. She deposed to the affidavit at the High Court of the FCT in a case involving her as plaintiff an Emeka Ugwuonye (defendant). Onochie in her witness statement on oath affirmed among others that “I am also a member of the All Progressives Congress and a volunteer at the Buhari Support Organisation.” She further told the panel that Mrs May Agbamuche a serving INEC national commissioner from Delta State is actually representing Cross River on the board of the electoral umpire. There was a sharp disagreement among the senators on whether Onochie should say the denial on oath or not but Gaya ruled that it was not necessary for her to do so and subsequently adjourned the proceedings. Meanwhile investigations by our correspondent have revealed that some APC members in the panel are currently trying to influence the confirmation of Onochie by putting it in the committee report which would be laid next week. A member of the panel told our correspondent on condition of anonymity that the basis for writing petitions against Onochie had been defeated. He said ‘The various petitions that we received on Onochie centred on her membership of the APC and the fact that her confirmation would make Delta State produce the two slots meant for the South-South region on the board of INEC. “However Onochie has told the panel that she is not a member of the APC. She has also said the Delta State-born woman on the INEC board is actually representing Cross River. “If the argument is that she is a political appointee even the Chairman of INEC Mahmood Yakubu was a Federal Government appointee because he served as  the Executive Secretary of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund during former President Goodluck Jonathan administration. “Personally despite being an APC card-carrying member and senator I don’t want Lauretta Onochie to be confirmed but we really don’t have anything to hold her back because she has cleared herself.” Asked if the affidavit she swore to at the court could not be used against her the Senator argued that events had overtaken it. He said “You can only argue based on moral grounds but the facts before us did not really empower us to disqualify her. “The law said nominees for INEC appointment should not be a card-carrying member of any party and she said she had stopped being a member of the APC since 2019.” Another senator who equally spoke on condition of anonymity said the committee was already in possession of a letter from the APC Secretariat declaring that Onochie had ceased to be a member of the party. He said “I don’t know how else they want the woman to defend herself. She has said that she is not a member of the party and we have a letter written from the APC National Secretariat that she is not their member. “As far as the committee is concerned the petitions before us seeking Onochie’s disqualification has been addressed” the source added. Senator Lawal Gumau warned other members of the committee against taking any hasty decision that the Senate might regret later. He said “Nigerians were quick to condemn the former Minister of Finance (Kemi Adeosun) but we are all surprised when the court vindicated her recently. “I don’t want us to do anything that we will regret in case we discovered later that she is not a card-carrying member of the APC.” But a PDP Senator who is a member of the committee insisted that Onochie must be disqualified because she should not be appointed. He told our correspondent on condition of anonymity that “the section of the constitution which disqualified her from the appointment states that she should never have been a member of any political party.’ When contacted on Friday the Chairman of the INEC Committee declined comments on the issue. Gaya said “I will not make any comments on the issue now. Our committee is still working on the report.” Meanwhile further findings by our correspondent revealed that the opposition senators have vowed to resolve the issue by physical voting during the confirmation at the Senate panel.

{"id":"30","headline":"I pray I never have to live outside Nigeria –Yeni Kuti","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/i-pray-i-never-have-to-live-outside-nigeria-yeni-kuti","stories":"Yeni Anikulapo-Kuti the firstborn of Afrobeat legend Fela Anikulapo-Kuti speaks to GODFREY GEORGE about her childhood and life journey You turned 60 recently. What are you most grateful for? I am grateful to the Creator for life and for health. I am also grateful for my children and grandchildren who are here to celebrate with me. I value family and see it as a gift. So I am grateful I am part of a family that loves me and that’s one thing to be grateful for. My partner was also there for me and that’s such a beautiful thing. What fond childhood memories do you have? You know I am old now (laughs). I remember going swimming at Onike Swimming Pool with my father Fela. I love to swim so much. Those were very beautiful times and I don’t take them for granted. Fela became broke after a while and that was very disappointing so we could not go anymore. I had one cent one time and asked him to take us but he laughed so hard because he knew he wouldn’t be able to take us there. You used to call him by his name? Yes we used to. He was a very simple man. Would you say your father’s simplistic lifestyle had an influence on your personal life as an adult now? It most definitely did. Like I said my father was a very simple man. He did not have the air rich and influential people have about them. He was very free and accessible. He spoke to everyone with kindness so there was no room for us his children to be arrogant. My mum was exactly like her husband. She was very simple and would smile most of the time to show how happy she was. Your father had many wives. Would you say this affected you or your siblings in any way? I wouldn’t say so. It didn’t affect me at all in any way. It was a very big family so I enjoyed myself growing up. Moreover I am the first child of the family so I wouldn’t say I felt some kind of way because of the presence of many women. But now as an adult I can imagine how it affected my mum psychologically having to live and deal with all of the other women. As the first child how have you been able to continue to keep the family united after all these years since your dad passed on? I tell people that the Creator doesn’t put what you cannot handle on your table. You enter the role that you are born to enter. He gives you only the things you can cope with. So I don’t see it as a huge task per se; I see it as a duty why I am put on this earth. I handle anything life gives to me with all that the Creator has embedded in me. Would you maybe later in the future consider relocating abroad? Never! I pray I never ever have to for any reason. My daughter lives in England with her husband so I always go there to visit them. I haven’t been there in over a year because of COVID and I am not going till the pandemic is over. I can’t live abroad. Never ever! Nigeria is the only place for me. At least I am a first-class citizen. You know one thing about moving abroad is that you become a second-class citizen in whatever country you decide to reside in. Nigeria is my country and I should stay here to build it. You don’t expect me to go to another man’s country to help them build their economy when ours lacks builders. It is us Nigerians who will repair this country nobody else. So where are we running to? This is why I did all my degrees here. We have to learn to be patriotic citizens and stay here in Nigeria doing our own bit in making Nigeria great. I know we have bad leaders but if we don’t all think together to make Nigeria great then there is a huge problem looming. A research report I read one time showed that black people in hot places in Europe like Florida thrive more than people in say New York Chicago or Canada where the weather is very cold. This shows that black people need heat to keep them going; they need the Vitamin D in their systems. So when we all keep moving we die early from sicknesses. I have an uncle who lived in Nigeria for a very long time. While in Nigeria he drank and smoked. When he moved to England first he was hit with a stroke and then kidney problems followed. One thing that baffled me is that he actually stopped smoking and drinking yet the illness came to him. I think for me it is the lack of vitamin D in his system that is causing all of this. It is here in Nigeria we thrive not there. That weather is not for us. I could never ever live in Canada; it is never warm there even in the summer. That’s like punishment to me. What are Nigerians doing there? Growing up your dad was arrested and put in prison by the government of the day. Did that have an impact on you and on how you viewed the country? I am not sure about that. I know that I don’t like the injustices that happen in the country especially with people in government. I don’t like how they treat the citizens who put them in power. I can’t seem to understand if they think about these people because I know it is not difficult to be good to your people. If you are good to your people you leave a great legacy for generations. Our leaders only think about themselves and how to fill their pockets. Do you share the sentiment that the country is too big to be governed by one president so Nigeria should break up into different units? No I don’t. Now the point is when the British divided us (Africans) they did so in a way that they put all these different tribes together so we will never know peace. Now it was not only Nigeria that was divided like that. We have Yoruba people in Benin Republic Hausa and Fulani in Mali Igbo in Cameroon. They did all this partitioning so all of Africa will never know peace. We are playing into their narrative. We have lived together for too long to break up; it is better we manage the situation and find solutions to our problems than break up. Can you imagine if Nigeria goes to war? The suffering will be terrible. Where will over 200 million people migrate to? Africa will feel the impact. No country will be able to accommodate so many Nigerians in their country. The white will use that as a licence to come into the country to sap our remaining resources and render us useless. This is why I keep saying we have a bad government. If our government was better the situation wouldn’t be this bad. These are the kinds of things Fela was talking about. I agree that we were divided wrongly but the best thing is to make good out of a bad situation. I agree we need to restructure but I don’t agree with so many states. Why do we need about 200 states for what? We are all in this same country. Why can’t we have say Yoruba State Hausa State Igbo State Calabar state etc.? If we want to use the number of tribes to do this division then I wonder how many states we will come out with. It won’t make sense. By the time we break up and have all our clamouring there will still be divisions and contentions so it won’t work. The restructuring should be in a way that we can live together in peace because the war that they are advocating our leaders will not be here to join us in the fight. They have their private jets which they would use to jet out of the country. Most of them don’t even live in this country. During the heat of the Biafra War in 1967 we saw the leader run away to Ivory Coast and let millions of his people die. We are the ones that will suffer if a war breaks out trust me. Even though I was in Lagos I felt the impact of the war. In front of our house we saw the soldiers carrying out Operation Weti e. It was terrible. If you had the chance of being president for one day what would you change? I would change four things: water electricity education and health. Those are the real problems of this country. If a leader comes in and tackles just one then at least we should be somewhere. Take a look at the healthcare system. Someone like me who is ill can afford to go to a private hospital; how about others? The private hospitals are even becoming so incompetent. One was so useless as to kill my sister from a wrong diagnosis. She was just 34 when she died. I was in England when my daughter gave birth. That day was when I realised that if you died in England then it was indeed your time to die because the level of professionalism and care they give you is out of this world. They don’t just give you drugs and injections without looking for the cause of the illness. When my daughter who is a National Health Service member was giving birth she was treated like a queen. The amount of care I saw from the doctors and nurses in the ward was tremendous. In Nigeria here it is by trial and error. One just wakes up one morning and decides to open a private clinic most times with no facilities. Our leaders waste no time going abroad when they are ill because they don’t trust the system. How did you feel when you became a grandmother? I have two grandchildren a female and a male. The feeling was out of this world. I was totally happy and excited. Like Dame Patience Jonathan used to say ‘There is God!’ At 60 you still have an amazing sense of style. What inspires your style? (Laughs) I think it is just being happy. I try – even if I may not always be successful – not to let things bring me down. I try to be happy with everything I experience. Life is full of ups and downs; take them as they come and move on. You cannot have everything your way all the time. I don’t know what I would say my sense of style is but I know I love to look good. I love to match my clothes. I think it is good to give a positive image of yourself so when you step out people will look at you in a positive light. I got a lot of my style from my dad. My father paid a lot of attention to his looks so that rubbed off on me. I don’t know if I imbibed it or was born with it. You left journalism for dance. What would you say informed that decision? Would you say you actually lived your dream being a dancer before tilting towards journalism again? Dancing was my passion. So when Femi was starting his dance group it wasn’t even a question. It wasn’t a hard decision to leave the corporate world to pursue my passion. I have no regrets whatsoever. It was the best decision of my life. It made me happy. I had the opportunity to travel all around the world and meet a lot of people. I saw a picture of you with a lot of dogs around. Would you say you are a lover of dogs? I am an animal lover not just dogs. I love cats and monkeys. From a very young age we had a dog named Dino a cat named Tino and a monkey Afrobeat which Fela got on his way back from a performance in the North. The dog was my sister’s the cat was mine and the monkey was Femi’s. All of us had to care for them. So you see it has been normal to have animals around. Afro was a terror to everyone. He was killed by the Nigerian Army because he went to a barracks to scatter things there. He was shot by soldiers there. What are your hobbies? I love to go anywhere there is calm water to swim somewhere in the Caribbean. I would love to visit Obudu Cattle Ranch; it is my dream place to go. What is your favourite food? I don’t eat my favourite food anymore and it is actually sad and surprising. I love pounded yam and oha or afang soup. I think I should eat them today. You were gifted a car by the ladies of Your View on Television Continental and also a plot of land by a property company. How did that make you feel? When I was given the gift I was over the moon. I still am. I never expected it. I love the colour; yellow is one of my favourite colours. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The G7 countries comprising Canada France Germany Italy Japan the United Kingdom and the United States are supporting the Famine Prevention and Humanitarian Compact with $382m (about N59.9bn) to prevent hunger occasioned by the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East. Speaking at the event in Abuja the British High Commissioner to Nigeria Catriona Laing said it was a welcome opportunity to discuss the compact and ways to foster collaboration with Nigerian partners the United Nations and members of the international community. The envoy said the G7 was concerned by the scale of the crisis in the North-East Nigeria and the huge number of people inaccessible to humanitarian aid. She called on the international community to act immediately with no regrets to prevent further decline. Laing noted that the landmark commitment agreed by the G7 in May was critical to tackling the root causes of famine and address the sharply rising numbers of people in need of lifesaving aid. She stated “The compact commits G7 members to urgently provide an initial $7bn in humanitarian assistance to 42 countries one step from catastrophe or famine with further funding to follow over the course of this year. The initial funding includes $382m for North-East Nigeria.’’ “This is not only about money. It is also about diplomatic action smarter financing and more effective responses to crises. As well as addressing critical funding gaps the G7 committed to act early to avert a crisis.” A statement by the British High Commission said the attendees stressed that humanitarian access must be improved to ensure lifesaving aid reached all conflict-affected communities. ‘’They also committed to work collectively to promote respect for and abidance to International Humanitarian Law and the protection of civilians. “In North-East Nigeria an estimated one million people are inaccessible to humanitarian actors due to insecurity despite international law obligating all parties to a conflict to enable safe sustained and unhindered access to all civilians in need of assistance” it noted. Representatives of the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development the National Emergency Management Agency and the National Commission for Refugees Migrants and IDPs were in attendance alongside officials from Borno Adamawa and Yobe state governments.

{"id":"33","headline":"Police ask court to dismiss FUOYE VC’s suit","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/police-ask-court-to-dismiss-fuoye-vcs-suit","stories":"The Police Special Fraud Unit has asked the Federal High Court Ikoyi Lagos to dismiss a fundamental rights enforcement suit filed by Professor Abayomi Fasina the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University Oye-Ekiti Ekiti State and two others. Fasina along with Mrs Bridget Oyaola and Mr Sulaiman Usman the university’s Acting Director of Works and Chief Internal Auditor respectively who were represented by Mr Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN) dragged the Commissioner of Police Anderson Bankole and a Superintendent of Police Akeregun into a fundamental rights enforcement suit marked FHC\/L\/CS\/684\/2021 asking the court for many reliefs. Among the reliefs sought are a declaration that they are entitled to know and be informed of the details of any investigation against them by the police; and a declaration that the physical invasion of the university’s premises by the respondents in an attempt to arrest and detain the vice-chancellor in an unlawful manner constitutes a flagrant violation of their rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999. The vice-chancellor also asked the court to award the cost of N50m being the general aggravated and exemplary damages against the respondents jointly or severally for the violation of their fundamental rights. However the police in a counter-affidavit deposed to by Supol Akeregun and filed by Chukwu Agwu asked the court to dismiss the applicants’ suit for being frivolous and amounting to an abuse of court process. The deponent averred that the police never invaded the premises of the vice-chancellor on June 17 and 18 2021 or any day at all but only visited the university’s premises to serve the vice-chancellor’s invitation over some criminal allegations which the police were investigating. According to the deponent the petition against the applicants is not only in respect of the fraudulent acts allegedly perpetrated as the vice-chancellor from February 2021 but also includes his tenure from 2017 when he was deputy vice-chancellor in charge of administration till February 2021 when he became the vice-chancellor of the university. Fasina had been heading more than 11 committees as deputy vice-chancellor from 2017 to February 2021 before he became the vice-chancellor. The committees were said to have dealt with contracts and other financial engagements. “The vice-chancellor as the then Chairman of TETFund Committee of the university and about other 10 committees allegedly fraudulently converted to himself and laundered about N13864925 through his son Fasina Tosin who is a postgraduate student at Stirling University Scotland. “It is untrue that the applicants are being intimidated. The applicants have yet to honour our invitation and the documents in my office relate to criminal infractions allegedly committed by the applicants. Also the available documents in our records obtained in the course of investigation revealed that the vice-chancellor is involved in the fraudulent conversion of funds from Ekiti State University as salaries while he was still receiving salaries as deputy vice-chancellor (Administration) at Federal University Oye-Ekiti” the deponent averred. “It is only a thorough police investigation that will determine whether or not the applicants are culpable. The applicants filed the suit to intimidate and circumvent the police investigation and possibly to escape the long arm of justice.’’ “I ask the court to dismiss the applicants’ suit with huge cost as it is frivolous” Akeregun said. The judge in charge of the matter Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke fixed September 20 2021 for hearing of all processes in the suit. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"34","headline":"Police allegedly torture 33-year old breadwinner to death in Bauchi","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/police-allegedly-torture-33-year-old-breadwinner-to-death-in-bauchi","stories":"A  33-year old breadwinner has allegedly been tortured to death by a combined team of policemen attached to the Yelwa Division and a vigilante group in Bauchi State. Saturday PUNCH learnt that the deceased Dauda Danladi was arrested by the team of security agents in front of his shop located in Yelwa Kagadama a suburb of Bauchi metropolis around 9pm on Thursday. He was said to have been taken to the Yelwa Division where he was allegedly tortured to death. When our correspondent visited the house around 6pm on Friday family members and several sympathisers were seen weeping. An eyewitness Liatu Nuhu who sells groundnut milk and rice gruel close to the shop of the deceased said the police and the vigilante arrived in Gestapo style and started arresting people indiscriminately. Nuhu said “I was doing my business when suddenly the police and some vigilantes came more than 10 of them and started arresting people. The Divisional Police Officer got out of the vehicle and directed them ‘Arrest him! Arrest him!’ “And that was how they arrested the boys playing snooker others who were chatting and the deceased who was standing in front of his shop. We kept telling them not to arrest him we told them that he was our neighbour here and we knew him to be someone of good character. We asked why they would arrest him but they still took him away.” Nuhu added “Today (Friday) in the morning we went to the police station around 7am they told us to stay at a far distance and wait for the DPO to come to the office. So I decided to go to my place of work. “By 10.15am I returned only for me to see the deceased’s wife crying profusely. When I asked her what happened she told me that her husband was dead.” When contacted the Commissioner of Police Bauchi State Sylvester Alabi told journalists on the phone that five people were arrested with a  revolver pistol in the area. He said two of them were later released because they were found innocent while the other two were still being held at the Police station. “The deceased was not even part of them he was about 200 metres ahead. He was gasping for breath in his business place and the police assisted him to the hospital and then he died. “If police had not assisted him to the hospital people would have said they are bad people. The police now assisted now na wahala (sic).” “I have told the PPRO to go to the media and tell people the correct version of the story” he stated. As of the time of filing this report 7.30pm the PPRO has yet to make any official statement. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"35","headline":"FAAN owes MMA2 over N200bn says Bi-Courtney","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/faan-owes-mma2-over-n200bn-says-bi-courtney","stories":"Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited operator of the Murtala Muhammed Airport Lagos Terminal Two says the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria owes the company over N200bn. This was said in a statement signed by its spokesman Mikail Mumuni in response to the Federal Government’s earlier claim that Bi-Courtney was owing the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria. The Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika had said that the ministry would begin to intensify its efforts to recover the over N37bn owed by airlines in the country and cited Bi-Courtney Limited as owing about N13bn. Bi-Courtney’s statement read in part “On the contrary it is FAAN that owes Bi-Courtney over N200bn by depriving it of its legitimate earnings over the past 14 years.” Mumuni explained that FAAN had been competing with BASL in running the domestic terminal through the opening and operating of the General Aviation Terminal which is a flagrant breach of the concession agreement. He further said the N14bn debt mentioned by the Minister was not consistent with the demands of FAAN. “BASL in line with the dispute resolution process contained in the agreement had an arbitration award in its favour. It also got the judgement of a High Court six Court of Appeal judgements and a Supreme Court judgement all in its favour and sustained the monetary award  “The N14bn debt mentioned by the Minister is totally inconsistent with the demand by FAAN the body which has been liaising with BASL. Their last demand was about N1bn which was promptly responded to by BASL stating categorically that there was no such debt.” The spokesman further said BASL is a law-abiding company which pays up its bills when due. “We believe that Minister was not properly briefed by FAAN as we also pay our electricity bills as and when due. We equally provide elaborate security at the Terminal which has continued to attract commendation from stakeholders. ” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

In a virtual court sitting held via Zoom on Friday the ECOWAS Court consolidated the cases marked as ECW\/CCJ\/APP\/23\/21 ECW\/CCJ\/APP\/29\/21 ECW\/CCJ\/APP\/24\/21 and ECW\/CCJ\/APP\/26\/21. These cases were filed by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project and 196 others Media Rights Agency and 8 others Malcolm Omirhobo and Patrick Elohor respectively. In the suit against the Federal Republic of Nigeria the applicants sought to challenge the action of the respondent in banning Twitter in the country. The court made the order of consolidation after hearing from the counsel for the four applicants and the counsel for the respondent who all agreed to the consolidation. There were two groups before the court seeking to be admitted as amicus curiae in the matter. The first group was the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Organisation represented by thier lawyer Ikechukwu Uzoma. Uzoma moved a motion urging the court to admit the group as an amicus curiae in the case. The second group consisted of Amnesty International Access Now and Electronic Frontier Foundation represented by their lawyer Deji Ajare. Ajare also moved a motion urging the court to admit these organisations as amici curiae in the case. The counsel for the Federal Government Abdullahi Abubabkar was opposed to the applications. Abubakar stated that he had already filed a counter-affidavit to the application of the first amicus curiae and was just receiving the application of the second amici curiae. He also stated that he would need time to verify if the second amicus was a juristic person who could sue and be sued in Nigeria. SERAP’s lawyer Femi Falana (SAN) in responding to the objection by Abubakar told the court that there is no law that requires an organisation could be registered in Nigeria before they can be an amicus curiae and that the groups were recognised as International organizations before the ECOWAS Court which was not a national court. The counsel for Malcolm Omirhobo and Patrick Elohor also aligned themselves with the view of the learned silk. The court after hearing the submissions of the parties granted the applications and admitted the organisations as amici curiae in the matter. The court subsequently adjourned to September 29 for hearing to enable all parties to organise themselves for trial. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"38","headline":"FG to decide on health workers’ hazard allowance","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/fg-to-decide-on-health-workers-hazard-allowance","stories":"•Resident doctors Ngige disagree over strike notice The Federal Government has said it will take the final decision on the new hazard allowance for health workers. The Minister of Labour and Employment Senator Chris Ngige stated this on Thursday while briefing journalists after a meeting of the Presidential Committee on Salaries relevant Federal Government stakeholders professional associations and trade unions in the health sector. Ngige explained that the government allowed enough time for the Nigerian Medical Association and the Joint Health Sector Unions to harmonise their different positions on hazard allowance but they were unable to do so. Consequently the minister said the matter would be taken back to the National Salaries Wages and Incomes Commission and the Presidential Committee on Salaries to decide on the new hazard allowance for health professionals and workers. These were contained in a statement on Friday by the Ministry of Labour spokesman Charles Akpan titled ‘FG to decide new hazard allowance for health workers directs NARD JOHESU to withdraw strike notices.’ According to Ngige the government is treading cautiously in order not to be seen as trying to stampede the health workers’ rights. He said “We would have separated them into JOHESU and NMA but that will give us a lot of problems in terms of the implementation of whatever we agree on. “We are taking them jointly and it is yielding fruit now. The two big bodies have given their final positions. The government has taken their final positions back. We have also allowed them time to see if they can discuss among themselves like they did just before COVID-19 and we came out with COVID-19 allowance. “We have given them time to see if they can meet and harmonise their positions but they were not able to do so. We are adjourning this meeting sine die for the government’s side to look at those two positions and see whether we can do a middle-of-the-road position within our organisation. The NSIWC which by its mandate is the government’s organ that fixes salaries wages allowances and remuneration.” Ngige recalled that the Federal Government earlier offered the health workers 300 per cent increment on hazard allowance which came to a quantum amount of N37.5bn. He said they were trying to work within that realm of N37.5bn following the inability of the unions to harmonise their different positions. “It is a teething problem because everybody has Collective Bargaining Agreements and we are now renegotiating the CBAs. There are CBAs in 2006 2009 2013 and even court pronouncements by the National Industrial Court especially on work value and equal pay. These are things we will put in a basket and decide” the minister added. Regarding the trade dispute notices issued by the National Association of Resident Doctors and JOHESU Ngige said he had directed them to withdraw the strike notices immediately. “I told them to withdraw because it is arm-twisting. It is not allowed in International Labour Organisation CBA negotiations. So we expect them to withdraw those notices they gave” he said. However the NARD President Dr Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa in an interview with Saturday PUNCH had said that the association would not withdraw its strike notice and neither will it succumb to threats by the Federal Government. He said “This is a joke. Our strike is not even based on the hazard allowance. Our strike is based on the ultimatum we gave sometime back and government has not attended to any of the things we stated in the memorandum of action so why should we withdraw the ultimatum? “The brain drain in Nigeria is much. Our members are being owed salaries. “Government needs to stick to what we signed on April 10. Going back to the MOA what has been achieved since then? Yes we had issues with the hazard allowance of five thousand naira to health workers. Have you ever asked what is being paid to senators and ministers? “Unless they attend to the MOA we signed with them we will not withdraw the ultimatum.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"41","headline":"Trial of kidnap kingpin Evans stalled again judge kicks","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/trial-of-kidnap-kingpin-evans-stalled-again-judge-kicks","stories":"The trial of Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike popularly known as Evans has once again been adjourned due to the absence of his counsel in court. The trial which has been in process for about four years now was earlier slated for Friday and was presided over by Justice Hakeem Oshodi of the Lagos State High Court Ikeja. Evans along with his co-defendants Uche Amadi Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu Ogechi Uchechukwu Chilaka Ifeanyi and Victor Aduba had previously been arraigned before Justice Oshodi on August 31 2017 on a two-count charge of conspiracy and kidnapping. The gang was alleged to have kidnapped Donatus Dunu the Managing Director of Maydon Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Dunu was kidnapped on Ilupeju Road Lagos State on February 14 2017 and the defendants allegedly collected €223000 as ransom from Dunu’s family. The trial had experienced several delays in the past due to varying factors and Friday has not be the first time Evans appeared in court without his counsel. On November 24 2017 Evans’ counsel failed to appear before the Igbosere High Court in Lagos and the matter was adjourned until January 22 2018 for hearing. Again on January 22 2018 the late arrival of Evans’ counsel stalled the court proceedings as the counsel only walked in when the case had been adjourned. The matter was then adjourned until February 28 2018. On June 26 2020 the trial was stalled due to the absence of the defence counsel for Uche Amadi and Ogechi Uchechukwu (second and third defendants respectively). Justice Oshodi had said “The court notes with disgust the attitude of the counsel to the second and third defendants. Their absence today has stalled any progress in this case.” It should be noted that Evans has had at least four defence counsel during the course of his trial namely Mr Olukoya Ogungbeje Mr Noel Brown Mr Olanrewaju Ajanaku and Mr Victor Okpara. Earlier this year the absence of a witness who was to testify in Evans’ defence had stalled his trial before the court as the witness whose name was not provided could no longer be reached via phone. The case was then adjourned until July 29 2021. While the five co-defendants as well as their counsel were all present in court on Friday Evans’ counsel was nowhere in sight. Our correspondent gathered that Evans’ counsel Victor Okpara was in Abuja and could not fly down to Lagos for the trial due to bad weather. Reacting to Okpara’s absence Justice Oshodi threatened the 1st defendant Evans saying “You would handle your case all by yourself if your counsel does not appear on the next adjourned date.” Justice Oshodi thereafter adjourned the case until August 3 2021 for the continuation of defence.

{"id":"44","headline":"Sickle cell and lack of health insurance","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/sickle-cell-and-lack-of-health-insurance","stories":"A few months ago I was speaking to a fellow warrior in the sickle cell community. Our conversation led to the issue of health insurance and she was so passionate about the topic that I asked her to write something to me about it. I hope you find this column informative: Managing sickle cell can be financially draining for parents and adults who are sickle cell warriors and this is the reason why many people refer to us as (money pit); meaning no matter the amount of money thrown inside a pit it can’t be full. However if we are going to change this label we need health insurance that can cover the medical expenses of sickle cell disorder.  I am Oluwakemi Oguntimehin a sickle cell warrior and founder of Ignite Sickle Cell Initiative. It is a known fact that Nigeria has the highest number of people living with sickle cell disorder in the world and despite the large number of people affected there is not enough health insurance to support the management of this disorder. Sickle cell disorder is a genetic disorder that causes a mishap to the shape of the red blood cell in the body giving it a sickle shape.  This disruption in the shape is responsible for many complications associated with sickle cell. Due to these complications of sickle cell disorder people living with sickle cell require constant care which involves an excessive financial cost. The management of sickle cell requires routine drugs frequent medical checkup routine blood tests emergency hospitalisations for painful crisis getting scans or MRI done high cost surgery due to some complications such as Avascular Necrosis and frequent hospitalisation for a crisis or due to many other complications as the case may be. Recently the cost of treatment in any Nigeria hospital has doubled due to user charges in public hospitals and high inflation. The cost of many drugs has doubled and many have tripled the initial price.   An infant single hospital admission can cost between N50 000 to N200 000 depending on the hospital and the complications treated.  This is a large amount of money that an average Nigerian cannot afford. Many parents have gone out of their way to borrow money and sell their valuables which my parents did several times and I have also done it too. I remember that my dad sold his Toyota Hilux to pay for my hospital bills.  Imagine him not having a Hilux to sell at that critical time? What would have happened to me? Some days I had to keep managing myself at home because there was no money to pay for the hospital bills or to also buy drugs.  My work in the rural community has made me aware of parents who have to use herbal concoction because they can’t afford hospital bills. I had seen warriors who lost their lives because there was no money for blood transfusion. Sickle cell management is highly costly and without medical insurance many can’t afford it especially those living in the rural communities. Many parents and adults who live with sickle cell have gone broke from paying many hospital bills; some sickle cell warriors have been abandoned to care for themselves by family members; many have dropped out of school and some have even died untimely because they couldn’t afford to go to hospital; many resorted to self-medication which worsened their health and caused more complications to surface and in many cases lives were lost. These can be solved with the provision of health insurance for people living with sickle cell.  Unfortunately many health insurance schemes in the country exclude sickle cell because it is expensive to manage which will leave the health companies with no profit. As someone living with sickle cell I can say that 70 per cent of my income goes to the management of my disorder.  I witnessed my dad sell his car to pay my hospital bills and other parents are left with nothing after paying for their sickle cell warriors’ hospital bills. Lack of health insurance for the management of sickle cell disorder is impacting on people living with sickle cell in the following way: Neglect by family members: Many people living with sickle cell have either been neglected or abandoned by their families because they see them as a curse due to the financial implications of managing the disorder.  Many of these parents will not have done this if they could access health insurance. High mortality and morbidity rate in people living with sickle cell: As we all know that people living with sickle cell can live long and ensure good health with good management.  However how do parents who are broke or who cannot afford to pay more hospital bills help their children living with sickle cell? And how does a sickle cell warrior who is currently unemployed and couldn’t afford to pay their hospital bills give themselves proper management? Lack of health insurance for people living with sickle cell is causing loss of worthy citizens who can contribute to the greatness of society. Increase in poverty rate among parents of people living with sickle cell: Due to high financial burden of managing sickle cell many families have become broke which can be avoided with the existence of health insurance. Late diagnosis of preventable complications: Because many couldn’t afford to go to hospital for check up and routine tests several complications are detected late which cost more money time and resources to manage.  With insurance it is easy to visit the hospital for routine check-ups. Less treatment received when sick: Many parents and sickle cell warriors often discharge themselves early including myself to reduce hospital bills because the longer they stay the more money they pay. Having health insurance will enable many people to receive the right treatment. High hospital bills: Health insurance provides universal health to people living with sickle cell disorder. People in rural communities can also receive good health care no matter where they are and who they are. Self meditation\/ drug abuse: When they can’t afford to pay for hospital bills people tend to opt out for self-medication and abuse of drugs like overdose under dose and addiction. Nobody wants to remain in pain for hours. With the provision of health insurance for people living with sickle cell many can live long in good health.

{"id":"46","headline":"Ogun #EndSARS panel awards over N218m against police others","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/ogun-endsars-panel-awards-over-n218m-against-police-others","stories":"The Ogun State Judicial Panel of Investigation into Police Brutality and Extrajudicial Killings says it awarded over N218m as compensation to 42 victims or families of victims of brutality and violation of human rights by the police and other security personnel in the state. The chairman of the panel Justice Solomon Olugbemi disclosed this on Friday while submitting the panel’s report to Governor Dapo Abiodun at the Executive Council Chamber Oke Mosan Abeokuta. Olugbemi said the panel after its findings recommended the payment of over N218m in compensation to 42 victims or their families. He added that the panel also made recommendations for the investigation discipline and where appropriate prosecution of certain security personnel to serve as a deterrent and in the interest of justice He revealed that the panel received a total of 106 petitions out of which 58 were treated and the remaining 48 were either withdrawn rejected or abandoned wholly or half-way by the petitioners. The panel chairman said “The 289-page report captured the testimonies and evidence of gory details of torture unjustifiable shootings inhumane treatment and other forms of human rights abuses leading to brain damage spinal cord injuries permanent disability death loss of means of livelihood unlawful seizure of personal properties and various forms of atrocities.” He also disclosed that most of the police officers that the panel came across were found to be grossly deficient in knowledge and professional training required for efficiency in the policing duty urging government to put machinery in place to address the situation. Receiving the report the governor promised to implement the panel’s recommendations towards having a peaceful society that would engender more robust relationship between the people and security agencies. Abiodun appreciated the panel members for their selfless efforts and contributions towards the successful completion of the task. He said “I believe that the implementation of this report will end the gory experience often encountered by residents of the state. “It is important for all of us as a people and security agencies to ensure and foster a mutually beneficial relationship.” Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"48","headline":"My marriage…With The Winlos","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/my-marriage-with-the-winlos","stories":"How did you meet? Anwinli: (That’s my husband’s favourite question). I met him in church. He was a Youth corps member in the city where I was based at the time. I was already through with service then. I came with a broken heart to church. Ohis: She came into the church and was going through counselling with the pastor as a first-timer. So the pastor sent for me because at the time in church I was referred to as minister for women affairs because I had a way of making ladies who came to the church then stay back. As usual pastor called me and handed over my wife Anwinli to me that’s how we became friends. There was no attachment we were just friends for about two years because she wasn’t my type and I wasn’t her type as well. Basically we were just working together in various departments in the church. That’s how we met. Since she wasn’t your type what made you propose to her? Ohis: As I said before she wasn’t really my spec because I actually wanted a chubby lady. (Laughs). At the time I only had a physical perspective of what marriage was but then I was meeting many friends who had those physical looks I wanted but they were not just it for me. It was then I knew that marriage is more than those physical attributes although they are necessary what is important is connection. Later on I realised I had connection with her but I did not notice it because she was not my spec. Then for the first time I thought of her and realised she is a good girl she is everything I need in a wife so what was wrong with me and why did I keep looking for a chubby lady? As I made up my mind that I was going to ask her out immediately she called me and said she was about to say yes to a marriage proposal. She said the guy was okay but did not share the same values with her so I told her to pray about it. I asked her for the guy’s name telling her that I wanted to pray about it but I went to search for him on Facebook and I discovered that this guy was rich and successful while I was squatting in my pastor’s house then. A few days after she later told me she said no to the proposal. I then proposed to her and assured her that though I didn’t have much if she would follow me as I follow Christ we would be married. She laughed when I said that but I was sweating. (Laughs). When did you get married? We started dating and a year and a half after we got married in 2013. You said you were called minister for women affairs how do you handle attention from female fans? Anwinli: (Laughs) That was then I have used prayers to block them. How have you been able to strike a balance between your family and career? Anwinli: Well it is a lot easier for us. We do similar things so we are together most of the time. Ohis: We are in a family ministry so we are always together work together and do skits together. Our home is also our office. How has the journey been? Anwinli: There have been ups and downs I can’t tell you that it has been all smooth. Our initial year had a lot of disagreements; I will say that came from my end because  I was stubborn and not ready to be teachable due to my background. But we have gone better and making tremendous progress. Ohis: We are from different backgrounds my wife came from a broken home and she saw the way her father treated her mother so she had the mentality that when she got married no man will boss over her. That affected us at first but with time series of counselling prayers and mentoring we are better today. What stood out for you on your wedding day? Ohis: I’ll say our wedding was a miracle. We wanted a small wedding but my father-in-law wanted a big one so we kept praying that God would touch his heart. One day he called me and asked me to come the next day with my wife and representatives from my family. We went (we took a video and camera guy along to record the event) he told us he had a dream and was told to allow us to conduct the wedding the way we wanted. We conducted the traditional wedding with eight of us and I wore jeans. We were in casual wear! Anwinli: The outstanding thing was that whatever we agreed on and envisioned was what happened on that day. That was very remarkable for us. What is your advice to young people on marriage? Anwinli: They should choose wisely; make sure that you are not in a hurry to choose. Your marital experience is a function of who you have chosen. You can have some desires that you think you need but God knows what you really need. Also agreement is key for success in marriage. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The Commissioner\/Chief Executive Officer AIB Akin Olateru disclosed this during the release of eight flight accident reports by the bureau at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja. He however insisted that it was up to the Nigerian Air Force to decide on whether it would make public the findings contained in the report stressing that it was outside the mandate of the AIB to disclose such information. After the crash the AIB was asked by the NAF to lead the investigation. Responding to a question on why the AIB had yet to release the report on the crash on Thursday Olateru said “Accident investigation takes time; an average of 18 months. The one you are talking about recall that it’s a NAF aircraft but the crash unfortunately happened at the civil airport. “So graciously the NAF felt we could be of assistance and then it commissioned us to assist in the investigation which is ongoing and whether the NAF makes the report public or not is not our call. “This is because it is not under the purview of the AIB.

{"id":"96","headline":"Suspended Kano cleric engages Islamic scholars in debate Saturday","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/suspended-kano-cleric-engages-islamic-scholars-in-debate-saturday","stories":"THE Kano State Government has fixed Saturday July 10 for a debate between embattled cleric Sheikh Abduljabbar Kabara and other Islamic clerics in the state. The state Commissioner for Religious Affairs Dr Muhammad Adamu made the announcement on Thursday in an interview with BBC Hausa Service. Recall that on February 4 2021 the Kano State Executive Council under the leadership of Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje approved the banning of Sheikh Nasir Kabara from preaching across the state for allegedly making provocative and derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad. The cleric later sought to debate with other scholars who had been challenging his mode of preaching. His request was granted by the state government but the debate was cancelled less than 48 hours to the initial scheduled date. Adamu said the debate would now be held at the Kano State Judicial Commission. The commissioner said he had already submitted an invitation to the teachers to compete with him. He made the remarks a few days after leaders of the State Council of Ulama accused the state government of “dragging its feet” on the trial and said they would prosecute Sheikh Abduljabbar for allegedly insulting the Prophet (PBUH) and his companions.

Counsel for the Yoruba Nation agitator Chief Yomi Aliyu (SAN) told our correspondent on the telephone on Thursday that he had filed an action before a Federal High Court in Abuja for the release of the 13 arrested persons. The lawyer did not give the details of the suit but he said spokesman for Igboho Olayomi Koiki had issued a statement on Wednesday that the DSS did not allow lawyers to see Igboho’s aides in its custody. Asked what step he was taking to ensure their release Aliyu said “We have filed an action before a Federal High Court in Abuja concerning their bail.  We filed it today.” The DSS had invaded the residence of Igboho around 1:30am on July 1. The secret police admitted to killing two of his aides and arresting 13 persons adding that its men recovered arms and ammunition. But Igboho who has since denied the claims said the weapons were planted by the DSS. In a related development the  Ilana Omo Oodua has said the 49 protesters arrested during the Yoruba Nation rally in Lagos will soon be released. The spokesman for the Prof. Banji Akintoye-led group Maxwell Adeleye told our correspondent on Thursday that the group’s lawyers had been working to ensure the release of the protesters that have spent six days in police custody. He said “We know that they have been in police custody for so many days now but our lawyers are working to ensure their release. “I don’t want to say what we are doing but i.cam assure you that they will be freed very soon because they did not commit any crime.” Meanwhile the Yoruba self-determination group Yoruba Ko’ya Liberation Movement has called on the governors in the  South-West region of Nigeria to add their voices to those calling for the release of the protesters.

The NCDC in a statement said the variant was detected in a traveller to Nigeria following the routine travel test required of all international travellers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory Abuja. The deadly Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organisation as a variant of concern given its increased transmissibility. The variant has been detected in over 90 countries and is expected to spread to more countries according to the NCDC. The NCDC Head of Communications Dr Yahya Disu in the statement said the variant had been linked to a surge in cases in countries where “it is the dominant strain” in circulation. “There are ongoing studies to understand the impact of the variant on existing vaccines and therapeutics. As part of Nigeria’s COVID-19 response NCDC has been working with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases and other laboratories within the national networ to carry out genomic sequencing. “This is to enable the detection of variants of concern and initiate response activities. All data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data. Given the global risk of spread of the Delta variant positive samples from international travellers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly” the statement partly reads. Meanwhile the Lagos State Commissioner for Health Prof. Akin Abayomi has said the state would not relent to punish international travellers evading isolation. He said “Anybody who tries to bypass the Presidential Steering Committee regulations will have their passports deactivated and will face sanctions when they are brought to the attention of the law enforcement agencies. “We have a number of people that we published in the newspapers who need to present themselves to the Lagos State Government and explain why they have chosen to beat the guidelines. We are in the process of applying sanctions to many people or deactivate their passports. “We are expecting a large number of children returning to the country from Europe for the summer vacation. We know that the Delta strain is circulating in Europe and therefore these sanctions are very important.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

A father of one of the abductees who spoke to one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity on Thursday said the school asked parents to pay any amount they could afford. According to him there was panic among the parents when they heard that the bandits threatened to starve the students if the items were not provided. These came to the fore on Thursday as The PUNCH learnt that the bandits contacted the school management on Wednesday evening and  specified the quantity of foodstuffs they wanted. An official who confided in one of our correspondents said the bandits said the parents must supply 30 bags of rice 20 bags of beans and 10 kegs of palm oil. Recall that the bandits had at 1am on Monday invaded the school and kidnapped 121 students who are mostly in Senior Secondary schools 2 and 3. The PUNCH on Tuesday reported that the bandits contacted the school management and demanded food to feed the abductees. The Vice-Principal of the school Wakili Madugu  during an interview on Nigeria Info Abuja 95.1FM on Thursday which was monitored by The PUNCH confirmed the quantity of food the bandits were demanding. Madugu said the gunmen rejected nine bags of rice as well as other food items offered by the school. Madugu said he received a call at 7.30am on Tuesday shortly after the students had been abducted and was assured of their safety. He further stated that the bandits said authorities had blocked their access to food and therefore demanded that the school and the parents make food items available. The vice-principal stated “They said we should bring 10 bags of imported rice 20 bags of local rice 20 bags of beans and then 10 cartons of Maggi (seasoning) and then 10 kegs of oil as well as two bags of salt. These were the items they demanded.” Madugu however said the school did not have all the items demanded because it had exhausted almost all their foodstuffs ahead of the school’s closure this week. But the father of one of the abducted students said the school had appealed to parents to donate money that would be used to buy the foodstuffs. The man stated “The school has asked us to donate any amount we can afford. It is not compulsory but many parents are eager to pay because the bandits threatened to starve the children. There are fears among parents when they heard that the hoodlums threatened to starve the students.” On Thursday evening a source in the school said the foodstuffs had been bought and that the telephone call from the bandits was being awaited. The source stated “We are waiting for their (bandits) call now to know where they want us to deliver the foodstuffs to them. “We (management) have bought the rice and other foodstuffs (food items). We are waiting for the call from them (bandits) for direction for where we will meet.  We have been waiting for their calls since morning. We have bought all the foodstuffs and all is set. The school didn’t make it mandatory for parents to pay  but some of them volunteered to give for the purchase of the foodstuffs.” Meanwhile all parents would dress in black attire today (Friday) for a special prayer session that will last for four hours. “There will be special prayers tomorrow and all of parents are going to wear black attires to last for four hours” he said. We’ve become helpless under this regime says ACF Meanwhile the apex socio-cultural organisation in the North the Arewa Consultative Forum has said it has become helpless in the face of growing insecurity in the region. It said while it was not opposed to dialogue as a way of seeking for a solution to the banditry and sheer criminality in the North it was totally against the payment of ransom. Publicity Secretary of the ACF Emmanuel Yawe said this in a telephone interview with The PUNCH in Abuja on Thursday. He said “These abductions have certainly taken a toll on not only education but also the economy of the North. As a group of patriotic Nigerians who are northerners it is glaring to everyone that the fact that we have a President from this region we are not having the best of times. “We believe in dialogue because a sizable number of the people doing this are Nigerians. Let us treat those involved in crime the way criminals are dealt with those with genuine cases who desire to be heard should be heard. “What is happening has affected us badly. Parents are no longer taking their children to schools; farmers no longer go to the farms for fear of being killed or kidnapped. “Sometimes we wonder whether the President or the Presidency read our statements because nothing appears to have changed. “There was a time Mr President said the kidnapping we saw the last time was going to be the last but since then kidnappings have increased we are really afraid of what is happening to the north.” Asked what the ACF was doing or planning to do to stem the tide he said “We don’t control the army police or any of the security services. All we can do is to continue to draw attention to the problem. There are people elected to deal with such issues we expect them to rise to the occasion. “We also expect the military to step up intelligence gathering because it beats the imagination that 200 or 300  people will move from one point to another on motorcycles to kidnap school children and disappear into thin air.” Also on Thursday the Federal Ministry of Education said the rescue of the 348 students still held in captivity  was the responsibility of security operatives. The PUNCH had earlier reported that no fewer than 348 students were still being held by bandits. Out of the 348 students three categories numbering 227 had been languishing in bandits’ dens many weeks after they were abducted from their schools in Niger Kebbi and Kaduna states. On Monday the situation worsened when hoodlums stormed the Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State abducting 121 students. Different organisations such as UNICEF UNESCO had expressed worry over the increased abductions with pressure groups such as the National Union of Teachers calling for the resuscitation of Safe Schools Initiative Programme to end the spate of abductions in schools especially in Kaduna state.  However the spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of Education Ben Goong who spoke in an interview with The PUNCH said it was the exclusive duty of security agents to rescue the victims. He said “Security operatives are saddled with the responsibility of rescuing the abducted students. It is in no way the responsibility of the federal ministry of education. “We are all sad worried and we understand that the parents are mourning however we can’t do anything about it. “Security operatives are already aware and we can’t say this is what we are doing because we don’t know the plans of the security agents. It is their duty and not ours.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Eyewitnesses said the accident occurred around 3pm directly opposite the Gen. David Ejoor Barracks of the Nigerian Army. The students were reportedly returning from school when the tanker laden with petroleum product  ran into them. The PUNCH gathered that three of the deceased students are siblings. Apart from the students who reportedly died on the spot some others were said to have been left with injuries and were rushed to the nearby Army Hospital inside Effurun Barracks and the Central Hospital Warri. It was gathered that 12 students were rushed to the Central Hospital Warri. Of the number a source said that six of them were confirmed dead on arrival while three others were reportedly referred to the Delta State University Teaching Hospital Oghara. A joint team of the Nigerian Army FRSC and other security agencies were seen making frantic efforts to recover students trapped under the tanker. Consequently the accident caused gridlock along the ever-busy Effurun\/NPA Road as it was blocked to vehicular movement while fire-fighters were also drafted to the scene to prevent fire outbreak. The acting Police Public Relations Officer for Delta State command DSP Bright Edafe said six students were crushed to death adding “The number is tentative.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The hoodlums  it was learnt attacked the community at 10:30pm on Wednesday. The kidnapping led to a protest by youths in the area. It was gathered that the bandits later released two nursing mothers and two hypertensive elderly patients when they noticed their conditions. One of the abductees was said to have escaped. “The nursing mothers were released because they took away their husbands. The bandits released them to take care of their babies”  a resident said. A family member of a victim said the bandits reached out to him saying there were nine people in their custody. According to him they are demanding  N180m as ransom to release nine abductees. “They (bandits) have reached out to me demanding a ransom of N20m for each for the nine abductees that are with them” he said. Meanwhile a nursing mother who spoke on condition of anonymity told journalists that the bandits tied her husband and other abductees. According to her the bandits who were in large numbers went away with her husband and five others within their vicinity. While narrating her ordeal the nursing mother explained that the bandits caught the community unawares. She added that when the bandits stormed their compound they asked them if their neighbours were home. She said “They( bandits) came at 10pm. Then my husband was still outside with one guy. They were discussing while I was inside because I had a  stomach upset.  I heard a  noise outside and I decided to come out to know what was happening. “As I came out I saw where they tied my husband and two other guys and immediately I wanted to go back inside. I saw some men with knives. They wanted to stab me and forced me to go outside. “My children were crying inside and I was shouting that they should allow me to go inside and pick my children but they said no and that I was not going anywhere. They ordered me to sit back then one of them spoke to the other that they should allow me to go and carry my baby.  I went inside and carried my baby and came outside. “The bandits were asking us if our neighbours were inside and we told them that we didn’t know.   They threatened us and said that if they should enter their rooms and see anybody that they would kill us.  They broke their doors and brought all of them out. They asked me to go inside and they went away with six  of them –  a man with his two sons my husband and two other guys.” Another nursing mother whose husband a pharmacist was kidnapped said  “They came shooting and breaking our windows after they successfully broke through the perimeter fence. We opened the door and they took my husband and me away  but I was let go when they heard the cry of my baby. On her part a elder woman who was later released by the hoodlums said her husband two of her sons were taken away but she was left to go when she fainted on the road. “Because I am a hypertensive patient and they noticed my health challenge and another hypertensive woman who also fainted they allowed us to go” she said. According to a victim who narrowly escaped the attack the bandits stormed the community shooting indiscriminately. The victim who is a lawyer said after firing shots the bandits pulled down their gate but couldn’t enter the apartment adding that “they(bandits) decided to break the wall” and entered the compound yet they couldn’t see us; my wife and me. “They took away my neighbour  who later escaped. We have four flats in our compound but they invaded only two flats. The bandits were speaking mainly Fulani language. They also speak a little bit of Hausa language.” Meanwhile youths in large numbers took  to the streets of Sabon -Tasha along  Kachia road in the same LGA in protest  against continued killings and abductions of  residents The protesting youths blocked the road thereby causing major traffic jam and as of the time of sending this report they refused to listen to appeals from security personnel. The protesters said  “We are tired of these killings and kidnappings every time” “we want the government to know that we are angry and if they can’t protect us we will protect ourselves” among others.      Copyright PUNCH.

Wariboko spoke to journalists shortly after a visit to the state Commissioner of Police Friday Eboka at his office in Port Harcourt accompanied by the leadership of the Rivers State Civil Society Organisation Wariboko who is from the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State said he was arrested on alleged charges of conspiracy and kidnapping of a monarch from the Andoni LGA also in Rivers. He explained that he was detained and chained in the legs for one month and 19 days without food adding that he was accused of conniving with a relative to abduct the traditional ruler. The victim added that despite the visit of his family to the unit the police refused them access to him until the involvement of the Rivers State Civil Society Organisation which took the matter to the state police commissioner. He said “It was very hectic; no food for me to eat and I did not even see my family to bring food; only God. I was leg-chained for one month and 19-days when I was in the cell. Even people who committed murder they didn’t leg-chain them. Anytime I called my IPO to give me food he would say no. “You may see him today then another two weeks before you see him again. At a point I fainted because there was no food for me. I just thank God that today I am alive.” He commended the police boss for his intervention.

In Ebonyi the state government said three persons had died while 12 other infected persons were currently responding to treatment in hospital. The situation is worse in Plateau State where 14 persons have been confirmed dead. The acting Commissioner for Health in Ebonyi State Dr Richard Nnabu gave the casualty figure after a visit to Amachi-Igwebuike village in the Agba community Ishielu Local Government Area of the state. According to him through the efforts of the state government the situation has been brought under control. Nnabu told journalists after the visit of the state epidemiologists to the area that the 12 suspected cases were being handled at the Agba General Hospital. “Keeping the environment clean and hygienic drinking safe water and good preservation of food items are very important practices to prevent the spread” the acting commissioner stated. Nnabu added that the deaths were as a result of the refusal of the patients to go to hospital for treatment. He charged the people to report any case of cholera to the nearest health facilities or go straight to the general hospitals where drugs had been provided for the treatment of the disease. Some residents of the community blamed the outbreak of cholera on non-availability of potable water in the area. They said they went as far as a neighbouring Onicha Local Government Council to get drinking water while those who could not travel the long distance resorted to drinking dirty pond water. In Plateau State  the Commissioner for Health Dr Nimkong Lar while briefing reporters after the State executive council meeting in Jos on Wednesday added that out of the 953 cases of infected persons recorded in the state 910 had been discharged while 29 patients were currently receiving treatment in various health facilities across the state. Lar said the disease which was previously recorded in the Jos North Local Government Area had spread to 13 local government areas. The commissioner further said the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control had visited the state to support efforts aimed at tackling the cholera outbreak. As a way of mitigating further spread of the disease Lar cautioned residents to be conscious about the sources of their water and handle their fruits with care to avoid being victims.

{"id":"120","headline":"Scandalous petrol smuggling and subsidy","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/scandalous-petrol-smuggling-and-subsidy","stories":"REPORTS and pronouncements by officials reveal astronomical levels of petroleum products smuggling the high landing cost of imports and subsidy amid seeming helplessness by the government to resolve the crisis. Despite an alarming disclosure that the daily national supply of petroleum products shot up to 102 million litres per day in May fuelled by massive smuggling across the country’s borders the Federal Government remained stuck in its failed responses of continued state involvement in refining import and distorted price-fixing. Unless it exits the downstream business altogether ends the distortions created by the state monopoly and misdirected subsidies and effectively neutralises smuggling there may be no end soon to the crushing burden of fuel subsidy on taxpayers. For a country badly bruised by two recessions in five years severe revenue shortfall and mounting debts the cost of the refined petroleum products quagmire is prohibitive. With all the 102 million litres “consumption” in May imported the subsidy bill has risen astronomically. By March said Mele Kyari the group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation it had climbed up to N120 billion monthly. With the landing cost of petrol now at about N240.17 per litre but supplied to marketers at N160 per litre the subsidy has spiked draining N6.07 billion per day. Worse still as oil prices rise in the international market landing costs and subsidy liability will remain high. Smuggling is destructive because it translates to Nigeria incurring huge sums to subsidise petrol for other countries. The government must put a stop to this ruinous haemorrhage. The failure to stop the massive smuggling of petrol to neighbouring countries where pump head prices are higher is galling. A report in The PUNCH confirmed large-scale smuggling of petrol across the borders facilitated by collusion by insiders and security agents. Another report alleged widespread over-invoicing of imported petrol cargoes and diversion of products falsely officially recorded to have been discharged inland. Without drastic action experts fear the subsidy bill may rise above N1.5 trillion this year. Nigeria incurred N10.41 trillion on petrol subsidy between 2006 and 2019. In 2019 alone it was estimated at N1.14 trillion while Nigerians recall how N1.7 trillion above the budgeted subsidy vote vanished in a massive looting binge in 2011. Faced with this morass the government’s response has fallen typically short of the radical reforms required. According to Kyari on the orders of the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) a collaborative programme is underway between the NNPC the Nigeria Customs Service the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and other law enforcement agencies to end smuggling and oil theft. The aim he said is to bring down petrol supply to about 60 million litres per day a figure Kyari admits to being also suspiciously high. Simultaneously it is bent on its failed strategy of “rehabilitating” the four moribund state-owned refineries and continuing the “price equalisation” policy under which the government pays out billions in a futile bid to ensure price parity in every part of the country. The ridiculous “bridging” policy gulps billions of naira each year. Officials have also been hinting darkly at possible hikes in pump price to reduce the subsidy bill and thereby pass the burden of official incompetence to Nigerians. Solving a problem requires identifying its root causes and adopting global best practices based on rational economic considerations. Nigeria’s petroleum downstream sector crisis is rooted in state involvement import monopoly lack of domestic refining self-sufficiency and weak law enforcement. This fuels corruption waste and elevation of primordial above national interests. Having run the four refineries aground and with the 650000 barrels per day Dangote Refinery nearing completion quick transparent privatisation of the refineries to capable private investors is the best option to foster competition and products self-sufficiency. The regime’s preference to borrow another $1.5 billion to “rehabilitate” them entrenches state intrusion waste and inefficiencies. The refineries incurred N1.64 trillion losses in the five years to 2019; in the first 10 months of 2020 they lost N85.75 billion but processed no crude. Competition promotes efficiency in services costs and pricing. Government should therefore open the space to more private investors to make Nigeria the continental refining and export hub. Ghana with far less crude (189000 bpd compared to Nigeria’s 1.34 million bpd currently) is seeking that title with a $6 billion energy sector ambition that has attracted significant international investor interest. Its decision in 2005 to liberalise its downstream sector said the Oxford Business Group and to overthrow state monopoly; independent operators now control 95 per cent of the domestic market in the country. There should be a drastic action to contain smuggling beginning with a massive shake-out at the NCS. Customs and other law enforcement agencies have failed the country woefully. They should be reformed and the porous borders through which fuel arms and ammunition as well as bandits and terrorists move unhindered secured. Buhari should probe the curious rise in daily petrol supply as verified by the National Bureau of Statistics from 38.2 million litres in 2017 to 57.2 million litres in 2019 and over 100 million in 2021! It is pernicious and cynical for the government to inflict further hardship on Nigerians through inflation-fuelling price hikes simply because it has failed in its responsibility to contain smuggling apprehend and prosecute smugglers and their corrupt official accomplices. At N162 per litre compared to N346 in the Niger Republic N359 in the Benin Republic N366 in Chad N449 in Cameroon N300 in Togo and N332 in Ghana (all 2020 figures) Nigeria’s pump price remains the cheapest in West Africa providing an incentive for smugglers. It is the responsibility of the state through intelligence- and technology-driven law enforcement to prevent smuggling arrest and punish criminals fund equip and ensure an efficient customs service and stamp out corruption. Government should stop transferring the consequences of smuggling to the economy. Subsidy and its abuse arise only because the country unreasonably relies on imports for refined petroleum products. Bizarrely the opaque graft-ridden and highly politicised NNPC has been the sole importer. To solve this let the government exit the downstream liberalise the operating environment to foster competition in production distribution and exports and thereafter end subsidies. The equalisation policy should be dropped today: it only fuels massive corruption and has failed to achieve price parity. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The blockade the second in less than a month left many commuters disappointed as both sides of the road were blocked by the protesters who made bonfires with disused tyres in the centre of the road. It was learnt that the protest was triggered by the recent activities of kidnappers on the road. The protesters while recounting the daily abduction of travellers on the road said a driver of one the popular transport companies was shot dead last week. Some of the protesters called on the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to come to the rescue of the masses plying the road by putting an end to the activities of criminals on the route. “We are calling on President Buhari who we voted for due to the change he promised us to please come to the rescue of those plying this road daily. These criminals have become daring as their activities have led to the abduction and death of many people” one of the protesters said. The Edo State Police Command spokesman SP Kontongs Bello confirmed the incident and said the protesters dispersed after the police had a discussion with them. “The information was that those who blocked the road were protesting against insecurity but they opened the road and dispersed as soon as the police in the area had a discussion with them” he stated.

Onochie was among those being screened for confirmation as National Commissioners for INEC. The nominee who had prior to her nomination swore to an affidavit affirming her membership of the party claimed that she stopped being a member over years ago. Other nominees who appeared for the screening include: Professors Muhammad Kallah (Katsina) Kunle Ajayi (Ekiti) Saidu Ahmad (Jigawa) Sani Adam (North Central) and Baba Bila (North East). Onochie arrived the Senate wing of the National Assembly at about 11 am accompanied by the Special Adviser to the President on National Assembly Matters Babajide Omoworare. She was immediately ushered into the office of the chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC Senator Kabiru Gaya. Trouble started when Onochie who was the last to be screened was ushered in to the venue. Onochie in her opening remarks acknowledged the series of petitions against her which bordered on her membership of the APC and the fact that someone from her state was already on the board of the INEC. She however denounced the party thrice before the Senate committee. She admitted being part of Buhari’s campaign organisation in 2015 before her appointment as the Special Assistant on social media. She also admitted swearing to an affidavit at an Abuja Federal High Court that she was a member of the APC. Onochie said “I have learned over the years to stand with the constitution and due process but not on partisanship or sentiments. “Since 2019 I have not had anything to do with any political organisation including Buhari support groups. “When APC was doing re-validation of party members I did not take part in that exercise. “As I’m sitting down here I’m not a member of any political party in this country. “I have no partisanship in my blood. I have seen many petitions against my nomination not only from the PDP but also from some APC members. “I’m not partisan; they know. It is about the law. No one has any reason to fear for my nomination as INEC commissioner representing Delta. “As far as I’m concerned I’m Madam Due Process. That’s why all the attacks. I follow due process; I follow the law.” However an affidavit dated 30th June 2021 which she swore to at an FCT High Court attached to one of the petitions against her contradicted her claims. She deposed to the affidavit at the High Court of the FCT in a case involving her as Plaintiff and one Emeka Ugwuonye (Defendant). Onochie in her witness statement on oath on paragraph three stated “That I am also engaged in active politics and a member of Neighbourhood Watch and has also contested the local government elections under the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. In response Senators Ifeanyi Ubah Seriake Dickson Istifanus Gyang and Ike Ekweremadu in their separate questions asked Onochie again to confirm her membership of the APC. Onochie denied her membership of the APC thrice. Consequently a suggestion by Senator Opeyemi Bamidele (Ekiti Central) that Onochie be placed on oath after she had denied her APC membership was supported by Senator Lawal Gumau (Bauchi South). The suggestion was frustrated by two PDP senators Ike Ekweremadu and Seriake Dickson who each argued that the Senate rules did not allow them to put any nominee on oath during screening. Chairman of the panel Kabiru Gaya ruled in favour of Ekweremadu and Dickson saying that Onochie would not be placed on oath so as not to run afoul of the Senate rules. Gaya subsequently adjourned the proceedings and said that the report of his panel would be submitted to the Senate at plenary next week for consideration. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The students had marched round the university’s main campus at Amassoma to demand the reversal of the compulsory wearing of uniforms closure of the fees payment portal and the ban on Students’ Union Government activities by the management. The unrest forced the management to announce the suspension of academic activities and shutdown of the university on Wednesday. The meeting presided over by the Deputy Governor Lawrence Ehwrudjakpo at the Government House Yenagoa agreed that the portal for the payment of school fees be reopened. A statement issued by Ehwrudjakpo’s Senior Special Assistant on Media Mr Doubara Atasi said the meeting also resolved that students should pay 70 per cent of the school fees at the beginning of every semester. It said “The remaining 30 per cent is to be paid before the commencement of second semester exams while year one students are required to make full payment of all fees to enable them to have their matriculation numbers. “The meeting also endorsed the prohibition of indecent and indiscriminate dressing by students with all faculties directed to enforce their respective dress codes and other regulations as spelt out in the 2015 students’ handbook. “On the issue of suspension of the Students’ Union Government it was resolved that the school authority should allow the formation of the body at the beginning of the upcoming academic calendar.” The Pro-Chancellor NDU Dr Matthew Seiyefa commended Governor Douye Diri and his deputy for their prompt intervention in the matter describing them as true fathers. Seiyefa a former acting Director-General of the Department of State Services gave an assurance to the students that the management would continue to take decisions that would earn them a better future. In his remarks the Vice-Chancellor NDU Prof Samuel Edoumiekumo described the misunderstanding as unfortunate and urged the students not to allow themselves to be used by disgruntled politicians. Responding on behalf of the students Proctor Joshua-Ebi appreciated the state government for its quick intervention. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

UNIDO declared its commitment towards improving IEE and resource efficiency and cleaner production in the country during a workshop in Lagos. The Minister for Environment Dr Mohammed Abubakar represented by the ministry’s Director Pollution and Control Charles Ikea said the successful application of IEE and RECP contributed to global efforts aimed at controlling negative impacts on the planet coming from the use of natural resources in production generation of industrial pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. He said “This project will make significant contributions to Nigeria’s quest for the reduction of GHG emissions from industrial facilities and impact positively on our nationally determined contribution. It will create cleaner and more efficient production processes and energy efficiency that would improve industries’ resilience in uncertainties of energy costs. “It will also increase the competitiveness of manufacturing companies in the country place the country’s economy on a low-carbon path and enable Nigeria to fulfil its obligations under the various multilateral agreements that she is a signatory to.” The Director-General MAN Mr Segun Ajayi-Kadir who was represented by Dr Oluwasegun Osidipe said the cost of generating alternative energy for the industry was high at about 30 per cent of the production cost. He said the cost of sourcing energy from the national grid and tariff increments by distribution companies without improved service delivery was not business-friendly. He said the introduction of the energy management system and energy system optimisation that could sustainably reduce manufacturers’ energy consumption and incurred costs was a solution the industry needed. An environmental expert at UNIDO Mr Oluyomi Banjo while delivering a lecture said “RECP Is concerned with the efficient use of materials water and energy by industries in the minimisation of their wastes effluents and emissions including greenhouse gases while fostering safe and responsible production of goods and services. “It will increase efficiency and reduce risks to humans and the environment increased productivity and reduce operational costs optimise investments in the sector minimise environmental compliance costs reduced business risks and create a smaller carbon footprint.” The Managing Director Bank of Industry Mr Kayode Pitan promised to support the project saying supporting industrial growth was a key mandate of the organisation.

While a two-storey building under construction collapsed in Amikwo  in the Awka South Local Government Areas another two-storey building collapsed in Oko in the  Orumba LGA. Four persons out of the 20 said to be trapped in the two incidents were reportedly rescued as of the time of filing the report. A eyewitness said “The Awka building around 2am falling on part of an occupied  two-storey building trapping many.” The building had been sealed by officials of the Awka Capital Territory Development Authority when our correspondent visited the scene. The Managing Director ACTDA Ven. Amaechi Okwuosa said the Awka building had been under construction for the past 10 years and was marked for demolition in 2018. “He said “Although the developer had commenced demolition of the building the right equipment was not used hence the collapse. Four persons have been rescued with varying degrees if injury.” Speaking on the Oko incident the Executive Chairman of Anambra Physical Planning Board Chike Maduekwe blamed the incident on “compromise on structural integrity.” He said the structure had been sealed while the developer had been summoned to his office.

Adeyeye made this known in Abuja at the maiden interaction with stakeholders organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Safety Standards and Regulations in. The DG said NAFDAC was supervising 165 pharmaceutical firms over 45000 food manufacturing companies and over 5000 Micro Small and Medium-scale Enterprises in the food and drug industries. Adeyeye who was represented by the Director of Planning Research and Statistics NAFDAC Fori Tatama said the agency takes the issues of health safety and environment seriously. Speaking on why the DG could not come in person Tatama said “She is currently discussing with the WHO because the WHO is carrying out an audit of NAFDAC which will enable the country to start manufacturing vaccines. The programme started on Monday and will last till Friday.” Also at the session the Ministry of Labour Employment and Productivity called for quick passage of the Operational Safety and Health Bill to ensure proper regulation of safety in work places across the country. The ministry’s Director of Occupational Safety and Health Mrs Lauretta Adogu said “The bill will seek to make comprehensive provision for operational health and safety in work and other matters. It will also seek to establish a national council for occupational safety and health. “It addresses several important issues and widens the scope of legislation as the new Act will apply to all workplaces because we enforce operational safety and health in Nigeria.” The Department of Petroleum Resources said most accidents in gas stations and petrol filling stations happen where such stations were not licensed by it. The Chairman of the committee Ibrahim Hamza had earlier said the entrenchment of effective safety and health systems required collective commitment and consultation among all stakeholders.

{"id":"219","headline":"NYSC certificate: I’ll take steps to redeem my reputation says Adeosun","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/nysc-certificate-ill-take-steps-to-redeem-my-reputation-says-adeosun","stories":"A former Minister of Finance Kemi Adeosun has hinted at a legal challenge to the smear campaign she suffered while in office. She stated this after the Federal High Court in Abuja ruled that she was not eligible for the one year mandatory service under the National Youth Service Corps scheme as of the time she graduated from the university. She vowed in a statement titled ‘Kemi Adeosun reacts to court judgement on NYSC certificate’ which she personally signed on Wednesday to take every step within legal boundaries to protect her reputation. Adeosun resigned her appointment as minister in 2018 following a scandal over a forged National Youth Service Corps exemption certificate. The former minister said “My lawyers have informed me of the judgment by the Federal High Court Abuja in the case of Folakemi Adeosun vs The Attorney General of the Federation (FHC\/ABJ\/CS\/303\/2021) in which the court presided over by Justice Taiwo Taiwo ruled that the Constitution does not require me to present my first degree certificate or any other certificate including the NYSC certificate to be appointed a minister. “More importantly he also ruled that I was not eligible to perform the NYSC by virtue of the Constitution. This is the position I have always maintained and I am happy for this official clarification. “The ruling vindicates me after a very traumatic spell. It is however not only a personal victory; it’s also a victory for many Nigerians in the Diaspora under similar conditions who are desirous to serve their country. “I wish to thank God my family friends my counsel Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) and numerous well-wishers for their love care and concern throughout this difficult period which has lasted three whole years. “I wish to add that in the light of the court’s ruling I will at the appropriate time and without hesitation take all further steps necessary within the law to protect my reputation.” Earlier Justice Taiwo Taiwo had ruled that Adeosun was not yet a Nigerian citizen both at the time she graduated and when she turned 30 years. The court also ruled that she did not need to present a certificate from the National Youth Service Corps before she would qualify for appointment as a minister. Consequently the court held that her appointment was neither illegal nor unconstitutional even without participating in the NYSC programme. In the suit marked FHC\/ABJ\/CS\/303\/2021 Adeosun had approached the court for constitutional interpretation on the NYSC certificate controversy. She was represented by lawyers from the firm of Chief Wole Olanipekun. The court stated that she was under no constitutional prohibition from holding any office on the ground that she did not participate in the NYSC programme. The court also ruled that she could not be subjected to any penalty in relation to her occupying a public office on the same ground. Adeosun’s lawyers expressed their satisfaction with the ruling stating that the ruling vindicates their client. “The court has made it clear that at the time she presented for public service starting from 2011 up till 2015 she was not required to perform the NYSC under 1979 constitution since the client graduated in 1989. “Through client’s travail which lasted sixty-nine days the client was never in doubt about her innocence. “Client chose to resign on September 14 2018 because client did not want the case to become a distraction to the government and the public. The client also believed that it would give her the opportunity to vigorously pursue a constitutional remedy to the end to clear her name.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"220","headline":"INEC maintains dead govs ministers others on voter register","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/inec-maintains-dead-govs-ministers-others-on-voter-register","stories":"• Commission fails to delete Alamieyeseigha Akunyili Abba Kyari on register The Independent National Electoral Commission has failed to clean up its voter register despite suspending the Continuous Voter Registration for 32 months The PUNCH reports. A check by our correspondent through INEC’s voter register showed that several notable figures who died years ago were still on the register despite promises by INEC to clean it up after the general elections in March 2019. Currently 84004084 Nigerians are registered to vote while INEC is targeting an additional 20 million voters in the recently launched voter registration. However there are fears that the INEC register is grossly inaccurate due to the failure of the commission to remove dead persons from it. Our correspondent observed that a former governor of Bayelsa State Diepreye Alamieyeseigha who died on October 10 2015 and had Voter Identification Number 90F5AF9CA1295190857 was still registered to vote at the Agbesi open space polling unit in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of the state. A former governor of Kaduna State Patrick Yakowa who died in a helicopter crash on December 15 2012 is still registered to vote at the UNG Madaki polling unit while a former Minister of Information Prof Dora Akunyili who died of cancer on June 7 2014 is also registered to vote at Agulu 2 polling unit in Anambra State. Akunyili’s VIN 90F5B162BC295703414 is still valid on the register. The immediate past Chief of Staff to the President Abba Kyari who died of COVID-19 complications on April 17 2020 is still registered to vote at the Presidential Villa\/Police Affairs Commission polling unit. His VIN 90F5B797C296828047 shows that he is still eligible to vote. A former Minister of Women Affairs Aisha Alhassan popularly known as Mama Taraba who died in May is also registered to vote at the Lamorde Primary School polling unit Taraba State. INEC and the National Population Commission had in 2018 signed a Memorandum of Understanding that would see the NPC providing information of dead voters to the electoral umpire. However a top source at the NPC told The PUNCH that the commission did not have enough funds to identify dead people. He however explained that the commission was working with INEC the Nigeria Immigration Service and the National Identity Management Commission to identify dead Nigerians and expunge them from the government database through a new digitisation scheme. The source who wished to remain anonymous said “We just launched a digitisation programme and INEC’s issue came up but funding is the problem. So this digitisation process will help us mitigate the problem. “INEC the NIMC Immigration and the Federal Ministry of Health are all involved in what we are planning and this issue of voter registration will be addressed.” Also speaking with The PUNCH INEC National Commissioner for Voter Education and Publicity Festus Okoye said he was aware of the development adding that Nigeria did not have adequate data of dead people. On why notable persons had not yet been removed from the register Okoye said when the voter registration was suspended INEC had planned to clean up the register but the COVID-19 pandemic happened and the commission subsequently shifted its focus to expanding voting by creating more polling units. He stated “It is going to be a continuous process but our main attention is concluding the voter registration which will take place for one year and we will display the names of those who have been registered every quarter and then do some level of clean-up. “It is a huge exercise but the truth of the matter is that in this country we don’t have reliable data on births and deaths and when you don’t have such reliable data this is what you have; but we will continue to appeal to Nigerians to come forward when the voter register is displayed to identify the names of dead people and those who are not supposed to be there.” Copyright PUNCH.

The government had on June 4 2021 announced the suspension of Twitter two days after the platform deleted a tweet by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) which many users found offensive. Three weeks after the suspension on June22 the President set up a committee consisting of five ministers to negotiate with Twitter. The Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed was appointed as the head of the committee. Others appointed include the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy Isa Pantami; the Minister of Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyema; the Minister for Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola(SAN) the Minister of State for Labour and Employment Festus Keyamo (SAN)and the Attorney-General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN). However nearly three weeks after the committee was set up it was learnt that the negotiations had yet to begin. Malami’s spokesman Dr Umar Gwandu however said all was set for negotiations to begin. He said “The negotiations have not started yet. The process for negotiation has started by the formation of the Federal Government’s committee.”  “The process is ongoing. The public will be properly informed through the media at the appropriate time when resolutions are reached.” An inquiry which was sent to Twitter on Wednesday had not yet been responded to as of press time.

{"id":"222","headline":"Fight banditry insurgency not Kanu Umar tells FG","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/fight-banditry-insurgency-not-kanu-umar-tells-fg","stories":"A former military governor of Kaduna State Col. Abubakar Umar (retd.) on Wednesday knocked the All Progressives Congress and Federal Government led by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for giving undue attention to the arrest of leader of Kanu than the banditry kidnapping ravaging the country. Umar argued that it was disturbing that rather than concentrating on insecurity threatening to cripple the country the Buhari regime was celebrating the arrest the IPOB leader. The former governor stated this in a statement titled ‘Nigeria: A nation challenged.’ Recall that Umar lost his commission in the Nigerian Army as a result of his principled stance on the annulment of the June 12 1993 presidential election acclaimed to be won by the late Chief MKO Abiola. He said on Wednesday that the Federal Government must go beyond the arrest of the Kanu and pay more attention to more security challenges threatening to cripple Nigeria. Umar argued that for the average northerners living in the North-West and North-East who had been affected by the activities of banditry kidnapping and insurgency the arrest of Kanu had no consequence “since it does nothing to ameliorate his harsh and brutal condition.” He said “The re-arrest of the IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu elicited congratulatory messages to the Federal Government which appears overwhelmed by the intractable security challenges and in dire need of any redeeming act. “This is clearly an exaggeration of the security threat Nnamdi Kanu and indeed IPOB pose to our nation’s security and unity. It is quite strange and disturbing that the Federal Government is paying undue attention to the threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting ones posed by bandits kidnappers and insurgents in the North West some parts of North-Central and North-East.”  He lamented those activities of “those criminals have resulted in the evacuation of over 20 per cent the villages in the North-West and North-East. Hundreds are being murdered and maimed every week. Many more are kidnapped for ransom.” He said “Over 1000 schoolchildren were abducted in the past eight months with over 300 still in the hands of the bandits and kidnappers who are demanding humongous ransom. Rape of women and young girls has become a daily occurrence. Most economic activities particularly farming the mainstay of the people in these areas are now all but impossible.” Umar counselled the government to deploy non-violent means in addressing the growing restiveness in the South-East of the country. He however noted that “IPOB and its leader may well be responsible for some of the violence including the murder of security personnel arson and destruction of public and private properties for which they should be held to account.” While touching on the unity of the country the former governor argued that Nigeria was better as one and indivisible entity than disintegration. The former governor carpeted the Buhari regime for not processing the skills in the management of the nation’s diversity. “Truth be told the Buhari administration has so far exhibited poor skills in its management of our diversity. Yet it has the benefit of great examples by past administrations and statesmen which should guide it” Umar said. Meanwhile the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami has described the views of the Solicitor General of Alberta in Canada Kelechi Amadi regarding the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu as an “outrageously ignoramus opinion that is eccentric and weird.” Malami on Wednesday in a statement by the Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the Office of the AGF Umar Gwandu insisted that there was no illegality in the arrest of Kanu saying “It was abundantly clear that bench warrant was lawfully and judiciously procured through judicial process by a competent court of law whose bail condition Nnamdi Kanu breached with impunity. There was no illegality in the entire process and the question of illegality does not even arise.” Malami wondered why Madu never spoke up when Kanu was inciting violence against Nigeria. The AGF urged the Canadian public officer to educate himself in matters of the law adding that Madu only left for Canada after failing to succeed in his country of birth. Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"223","headline":"National Assembly ignores South govs others defends controversial PIB provisions","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/nassembly-ignores-south-govs-others-defends-controversial-pib-provisions","stories":"There are strong indications that the National Assembly will ignore opposition to some provisions of the Petroleum Industry Bill recently passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives. The PUNCH on Wednesday gathered that after the harmonisation of the versions of the bill passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives  the bill would be submitted to the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for assent. After 13  years of its introduction both the House and the Senate on Thursday passed the bill. While the House proposed five per cent share for host communities the Senate suggested three per cent. The National Assembly also proposed 30 per cent of the profit of the planned Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited for oil exploration in frontier basins which are mostly in the North. But at their meeting in Lagos on Monday southern governors rejected setting aside  30 per cent of the NNPCL’s profit for oil prospecting in frontier basins. They also opposed three per cent share proposed for host communities. On his part a prominent leader in the Niger Delta Chief Edwin Clark described  the bill as satanic. Already both chambers have set up conference committees to harmonise the different versions of the bill. The PUNCH however learnt on Wednesday that the conference committee would only focus on the areas of difference and would not tinker with the provisions under criticism. Speaker of the House Femi Gbajabiamila had on Tuesday constituted a conference committee to harmonise the differences in the versions of the PIB passed by the Senate and the House. Gbajabiamila announced members of the panel as including the Chairman of the House’ Ad Hoc Committee on PIB and Majority Whip of the House Mohammed Monguno  and six others as members They are Victor Nwokolo Ademorin Kuye Kingley Uju Tijjani Yusuf Ibahim Hamza and Mansur Soro. On Wednesday when asked if the joint committee of both chambers would consider issues raised by the southern governors and other stakeholders a member of the panel who spoke to one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity  said the lawmakers would only concern themselves with resolving the differences in the versions passed. He stated “Conference committees are meant to harmonise differences reached by two chambers. So if this (Senate and House’ 3%\/5% disparity) is the only difference that is it.” But the House hit hard at critics of the PIB and described opposition to the bill provisions on host communities as hasty and propelled by lack of in-depth analysis. The Chairman of the House Committee on Media and Public Affairs Benjamin Kalu in a statement made available to one of our correspondents dismissed the controversy over the definition of ‘host communities.” According to Kalu states hosting production facilities of international oil companies are also considered as host communities. The note  was titled ‘The Petroleum Industry Bill 2020: A Simplified Explanation to the Constituents of Bende Federal Constituency by Rep. Benjamin Okezie Kalu Member Representing Bende Federal Constituency of Abia State and the Spokesman of the House of Representatives.’ Kalu said “On the 1st of July 2021 both chambers of the parliament went through the clause by clause consideration of the bill in preparation for the third reading which was a major achievement although not without a call from the public to explain grey areas appearing discriminatory to the host communities while claiming that a section of the nation is set up to benefit from both the Host Community Trust Fund as well as the Frontier Exploration Fund.” The lawmaker said he considered the opposition as “a hasty conclusion propelled by the lack of an in-depth analysis of the bill.” Kalu said “In Section 318 under the interpretation section ‘host community’ is defined as those communities situated in or appurtenant to the area of operation of a settlor and any other community as a settlor may determine pursuant to chapter 3 of the bill. “These are those communities housing the production assets of the settlors (the IOCs) and are compensated for the loss of surface use of land for exploration after the land survey is carried out. “The IOCs know their hosts at all times. There is zero ambiguity on this as no settlor will accept to fund those who are not hosting them. Surely the IOCs have a role to play in determining this especially when one looks at the provisions of the bill with regard to the host Community Trust Fund and the process of setting up the organisational structure as well as the implementation guidelines as outlined by the bill. Nigerians are assured that the Trust Fund will take care of the host communities to the exclusion of all others. “Pipeline routes are not host communities they are impacted communities under the care of the operators in the course of their operations. It is still not obvious which part of the bill mandated the Host Community Trust Fund to cater for the needs of the ‘impacted communities.’ These divisive propagandist theories should be ignored fully.” The House spokesman noted that what the executive sponsored bill proposed was an annual contribution of 2.5 per cent of the operating expenditure of the preceding year of the IOCs to fund this as provided for in Section 240(2) which the House amended based on technical advice to 5 per cent though the host communities asked for 10 per cent. “The reason behind our decision is to ensure that the financial burden is not much on the investors in this era of great competition across the sector. Since the desire of every investor in choosing the destinations for investment is majorly profit it presupposes that for our bargaining to be attractive it should create value for the investors to energise their buy-in. The point remains we can’t fund the whole nine yards of exploration and production without foreign direct investments. Several members of the House declined to speak on the record over the controversial clauses. Some members especially from the southern part of the country said copies of the report on the PIB were distributed late to lawmakers. “The document is voluminous and some of us received the report on the morning of the day it was to be considered. No one could have seen all the loopholes within the short period” a member from the South-East said. In the Senate a member of the panel told one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity that the committee met on Wednesday. He said members only deliberated on the issue of five per cent equity share for the host communities passed by the House of Representatives and the three per cent approved in the Senate. He said “ When there is a conference committee the essence is to reconcile only the areas where there are differences in the bill passed by both chambers. “At the moment  there are no other areas of disagreement apart from the oil equity share. While Senate approved 3 per cent the House passed 5 per cent. “During our meeting today (Wednesday) some of our members suggested that we adopt the House decision of 5 per cent while others said jerking the Senate version up from 3 to 4 per cent would be okay. “ From the look of things the Senate Committee would canvass 4 per cent oil equity share during our joint conference meeting with the House of Representatives. “We won’t be able to touch other clauses because they are no differences in the Senate and House versions.” The President of the Senate Dr Ahmad Lawan had on Tuesday said the panel would meet with their counterparts in the House of Representatives as early as possible to reconcile the differences in the two versions passed. The Senate President said the conference committee would start sitting immediately so that the National Assembly could transmit the harmonised the bill to the President. Lawan charged members of the conference committee to meet with their counterparts in the House of Representatives to enable the National Assembly to come up with a final document on the PIB for transmission to the Executive arm of government. He had said “The conference committee will meet with our counterparts in the House the House will also announce the composition of the conference committee. “We hope that they will swing into action immediately so that we are able to have the final document of the PIB which we will transmit for the presidential assent. “So we expect our delegation here under the leadership of the Senate Leader to engage with our colleagues in the House of Representatives.” The PUNCH had on Tuesday reported that the National Assembly might transmit the PIB passed by both chambers of the federal Parliament to the President for assent next week. A principal officer of the Senate who spoke with The Punch on conditions of anonymity on Monday had confirmed that the Senate and the House of Representatives would harmonise their different positions on the Bill latest by Tuesday next week. The Senator had  said the conference committee of the two chambers which would harmonise the two versions of the bill would start sitting before the end of the week. He had said “It is just that people love to play politics with everything. This is not the first time that the Senate and the House of Representatives would pass different versions of a Bill. “The usual conference committee would be constituted this week to harmonise the different versions and they are likely to submit their report early next week. “We are going on our annual recess on July 15th and we would transmit the bill to the President before we go on vacation. Both the Senate and the House of Representative’s leaderships have said so on number of occasions.” The Pan Niger Delta Forum in its reaction insisted that there was no going back on the rejection of the three per cent for host communities. It also reiterated its rejection of the five per cent okayed by the House of Representatives. PANDEF National Publicity Secretary Ken Robinson said this on telephone to our correspondent on Wednesday. This is as Robinson took a swipe on the House Chairman on Media and Publicity Benjamin Kalu on his remarks on the Petroleum Industry Bill. He said “PANDEF is amazed at the comments of one Hon. Benjamin Kalu who is representing  Bende Federal Constituency in Abia State. “We have also rejected the fraudulent and provocative 30 per cent of profits that have been designated for frontier exploration funds. “But for us we are rejecting the insults and we are saying that we will resist it. Our people we are talking and consulting and we will respond appropriately to the disrespect being meted out to the Niger Delta people by the National Assembly and its leadership and by the Nigerian state” he added.    Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"224","headline":"Bayelsa varsity shut as protest over uniform continues","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/bayelsa-varsity-shut-as-protest-over-uniform-continues","stories":"The management of the Bayelsa State-owned Niger Delta University on Wednesday announced the shutdown of the school following sustained demonstration by the students. The announcement was contained in a memo dated July 7 2021 and signed by the Registrar NDU Mr Benjamin Joffa. The students had on Monday commenced a peaceful protest against the decisions of the management to introduce uniforms banning of students’ union activities and closure of the fees portal for old students among others. They marched round the main campus at Amassoma chanting solidarity songs and demanding the reversal of the decisions. The placard-carrying undergraduates alleged that engineering students would pay as much as N30000 each for their uniform while those from other faculties would pay N20000 each. They also called on Governor Douye Diri to sack the Vice-Chancellor Prof Samuel Edoumiekumo for alleged high-handedness and outrageous policies. In a copy of the memo sighted by our correspondent the institution’s management said that academic activities had been suspended indefinitely. It also asked all the students to vacate the campuses and other facilities not later than 3pm on Wednesday. The statement read “Following the ongoing unrest in the university I am directed to inform the general public and the university community that academic activities have been suspended indefinitely with immediate effect. “Consequently all students are directed to vacate the university’s campuses and its facilities on or before 3pm today Wednesday July 7 2021.” Before the closure of the school there were reports that the state government through the office of the Commissioner for Education Gentle Emelah and the House Committee on Education had separately intervened in the crisis and held meetings with the university’s officials led by Edoumiekumo. The vice-chancellor had in June come under attack over discrimination against a physically-challenged man who was a deputy bursar in the school which sparked a protest. The physically-challenged man was reportedly denied the opportunity of appearing for an interview for the position of bursar and had remained suspended following the protest although Diri addressed the management on the development.

{"id":"226","headline":"Senate approves Buhari’s N2.3tn external borrowing request","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/senate-approves-buharis-n2-3tn-external-borrowing-request","stories":"The Senate on Wednesday approved the request of the President Major General Muhammadu (retd.) to borrow N2.34tn to finance part of the 2021 federal budget of N13tn. The Senate resolution following the approval of its Committee on Local and Foreign Loans was presented by the chairman Clifford Ordia. The committee recommended that the Senate approves Buhari’s request for the issuance of $3bn but not more than $6.18bn Eurobond in the International Capital Market. The external borrowing of N2.34tn according to the panel should be for the financing of part of the deficit authorised in the 2021 Appropriation Act. The committee also recommended that the Senate should approve that the amount authorised may be raised from multiple sources such as the International Capital Market and any other multilateral or bilateral sources as may be available. It also recommended that the Senate should direct the Minister of Finance Budget and National Planning the Director General of the Debt Management Office and the Governor the Central Bank of Nigeria to submit to the National Assembly within 10 working days (excluding the day of close of trading) a letter containing the United State Dollars amount so raised and received as a result of the above approval together with the applicable exchange rate. Ordia said that in considering the president’s request the committee noted the serious concerns of Nigerians about the level of sustainability and servicing of Nigeria’s external borrowing. He said “Due to the shortfall in our annual revenues in relation to our need for rapid infrastructural and human capital development we had to pass deficit budget every year requiring us to borrow to finance the deficit in our budget.” Ordia explained that the new borrowing was calculated at exchange rate of $1\/N379 and raised from multiple sources – multilateral and bilateral lenders through the issuance of Eurobonds in the International Capital Market. He emphasised that the proceeds of the $6.183bn would be used to fund various specific capital projects specifically from priority sectors of the economy namely; Power Transportation Agriculture and Rural Development Education Health Provision of counterpart funding for Multilateral and Bilateral Projects Defense and Water Resources. President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan advised the Federal Government to sustain adequate funding of security agencies in the 2022 budget to be presented to the National Assembly later this year. He said doing so remained a sure way to overcome the lingering security challenges faced by the country. He explained that the amount passed in the supplementary Appropriation Bill 2021 was for the purpose of tackling insecurity across the country and procuring COVID-19 vaccines for Nigerians. He said “This supplementary budget is targeted at addressing the security challenges in this country and of course the procurement administration and management of the Covid-19 vaccines. “We expect the relevant committees to be stiff to be alive to their responsibilities for over sighting on how these funds would be deployed prudently.” However a Civil Society Organisation Niger Delta Budget Monitoring Group in collaboration with an English non-governmental organisation OXFAM told the Federal Government to be cautious of being over-dependent on loans to finance its budgets. The group’s position was contained in a communique issued after a two-day advocacy roundtable on civic inclusion budget monitoring transparency accountability gender inclusion and alliance building held in Uyo the Akwa Ibom State capital. The communiqué signed by its drafting team Ebere Chikezie Stive Obodoekwe Adeyemi Folake and Titilayo Sarakiri noted that excessive loan acquisition was mounting unbearable pressure and further impoverishing Nigerians.

{"id":"227","headline":"Rivers community fumes over deplorable East-West road issues ultimatum","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/rivers-community-fumes-over-deplorable-east-west-road-issues-ultimatum","stories":"A Pan-ethnic social rights group Ogoni People’s Assembly has issued a 14-day ultimatum to the Federal Government and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Senator Godswill Akpabio to commence reconstruction of the Eleme-Onne section of the East-West Road or prepare for a mass action. The group described the 15-kilometre section of the road as the busiest and most economically viable after Apapa in Lagos State due to the volume of daily traffic into major national assets including the oil and gas free zone in Rivers State. Leader of the assembly Probel William in Port Harcourt Rivers State on Wednesday said the road was included in the projects funded by the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund. William said when funds were to be released to contractors Akpabio took back the project to his ministry. The assembly comprising Ogoni-based civil society youths women and rights groups urged Akpabio to return the Eleme-Onne section to the PIDF. “This road is the major access to other important federal government investments like Aluminum Smelting Plant at Ikot-Abasi the fertilizer plant at Onn  the two Port Harcourt Refineries the Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas in Bonny and other large industrial complexes in Rivers Akwa Ibom and Cross River states. “We demand that the Minister for Niger Delta Affairs immediately return the deplorable Eleme-Onne section of the East-West Road to the PIDF or look for money to commence work within 14 working days from today the 7th of July 2021. “Failure to do this we will be compelled to embark on a non-violent mass civil action without further reminder. The refusal of the minister (Senator Akpabio) to do anything about this Eleme-Onne section of the East-West Road has caused the Ogoni people and other Nigerians travelling through that area untold hardship. Also speaking a member of the assembly and prominent Ogoni activist Celestine Akpobari said “The mass action we are talking about will include crippling economic activities in the area so that Nigeria can feel our pain.” Copyright PUNCH.

Also passed was a bill to establish the Institute of Information and Communication Technology Ogoja Cross River state. Both bills were passed by the upper chamber after the presentation and consideration of two separate reports by the Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND. Senator Sandy Onor (PDP Cross River Central) presented the report on behalf of the Committee’s Chairman Ahmad Babba Kaita (APC Katsina North).

Dabna is less than three kilometres from Garaha the hometown of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation Boss Mustapha. Eighteen corpses had so far been recovered from the dawn attack and more bodies were being expected to be discovered because of the way the attack was carried out. The Chairman Hong Local Government Area Adamawa State James Pukuma who gave the casualty figure said a joint team of security officials had restored normalcy and was helping with the recovery of the dead. He explained that the attackers did not come looking for food but to cause terror adding that the attackers who came on 11 motorbikes waylaid and gunned down fleeing members of the community. The council boss added “The attackers came on motorbikes and waylaid their victims who they chased and opened fire on. We learnt that they came on 11 motorbikes each conveying two to three persons. So far 18 corpses have been recovered with the help of security agents who have restored normalcy. “Most of the attacks are around the Sambisa axis; we want our people to be vigilant and report any suspicious movement to security agencies. Because this is the rainy season without such measures it means vast communities from these areas will be unable to farm.” Earlier a resident of the area who spoke to The PUNCH on the telephone said no fewer than 20 bodies had been recovered following the attack. “This morning (Wednesday) heavily armed gunmen invaded Dabna community. No fewer than 20 persons are believed to have been killed in the attack. At the moment the military has recovered 18 corpses. One of the vigilantes in the area was also killed. The attack also affected Garka where a lot of residents fled to” he said. The military however said the information at its disposal was that only two corpses had been recovered from the community. The Army Public Relations Officer 23 Armoured Brigade Jalo Cantonment Major Sani Mohammed told our correspondent on the telephone that the brief he had indicated that only two corpses were recovered after the attack. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state DSP Suleiman Nguroje said he was not authorised to speak on the attack since it had to do with Boko Haram. In his reaction former Vice President Atiku Abubakar condemned the attacks. The 2019  presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party on his official Facebook page wrote “I categorically condemn the killings in some communities of Adamawa earlier today he said. “Human life is sacrosanct and no matter how often these attacks occur we must never get used to them.

The decision followed the consideration of reports of various committees set up to review the conduct of examinations in the institution. Among the students expelled was Adeyemi Michael Seun with matriculation number 2019\/ND\/ARC\/011 from the Department of Architectural Technology who was found in possession of a textbook relevant to the examination he was taking. Mohammed Iliasu Maikudi from the Public Administration Department with matric number 2018\/HND\/PAD\/769 and Kadiri Samson 2017\/ND\/OTM\/034 from the Department of Office Technology and Management were expelled for hiring mercenaries to sit examinations for them. The board is also in the process of withdrawing the certificates of their accomplices Oladimeji Emmanuel and Ekeono Oluwaseyi who are former students of the institution for unworthy actions that portrayed the polytechnic in a bad light. Twenty-four other students from the School of Management Studies were expelled for various offences related to examination malpractices. The board also considered the recommendations of the Academic Board Results Verification Committee and approved the supplementary results of 3262 students for the 2018\/2019 session. It also approved an offer from the Federal University Lokoja to establish its study centre in the polytechnic for the purpose of running programmes such as top-up conversion and post-graduate programmes. While commending members of the board for the support so far the Rector of the polytechnic Dr Salisu Usman restated the management’s commitment to upholding the dignity of the institution through strict adherence to rules.

The group claimed such allegations were mere propaganda by the Commissioner of Police in Imo State Abutu Yaro to implicate its leader Nnamdi Kanu who is currently in the custody of the Department of States Services in Abuja. According to IPOB the claims by Yaro that four members of the ESN were recently arrested while planting explosives are not only false but mischievous describing the claims as another subtle move to further implicate Kanu. The secessionist group stated this in a statement signed by its Director of Media and Publicity Emma Powerful a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH. The statement read in part “We the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra under the leadership of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu have noted with great amusement the desperation of the Imo State Commissioner of Police Abutu Yaro in collaboration with the Imo State Supreme Court Administrator Hope Uzodimma to implicate the Eastern Security Network and IPOB through trumped up and laughable allegations. “This desperation smear campaign and media propaganda are part of their agenda to blackmail IPOB and possibly establish grounds to indict our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu currently in the custody of the Department of State Services. But they will not succeed because the world already knows the truth. “We therefore wish to refute the claims by the Imo CP that the four persons paraded by the police in Imo were ESN operatives arrested while attempting to plant explosives in the state. There is no element of truth in such claims aimed at demonising the ESN and portraying the gallant security outfit as a terrorist organisation which it is not.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"240","headline":"N’Assembly ignores South govs others defends controversial PIB provisions","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/nassembly-ignores-south-govs-others-defends-controversial-pib-provisions","stories":"There are strong indications that the National Assembly will ignore opposition to some provisions of the Petroleum Industry Bill recently passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives. The PUNCH on Wednesday gathered that after the harmonisation of the versions of the bill passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives  the bill would be submitted to the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for assent. After 13  years of its introduction both the House and the Senate on Thursday passed the bill. While the House proposed five per cent share for host communities the Senate suggested three per cent. The National Assembly also proposed 30 per cent of the profit of the planned Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited for oil exploration in frontier basins which are mostly in the North. But at their meeting in Lagos on Monday southern governors rejected setting aside  30 per cent of the NNPCL’s profit for oil prospecting in frontier basins. They also opposed three per cent share proposed for host communities. On his part a prominent leader in the Niger Delta Chief Edwin Clark described  the bill as satanic. Already both chambers have set up conference committees to harmonise the different versions of the bill. The PUNCH however learnt on Wednesday that the conference committee would only focus on the areas of difference and would not tinker with the provisions under criticism. Speaker of the House Femi Gbajabiamila had on Tuesday constituted a conference committee to harmonise the differences in the versions of the PIB passed by the Senate and the House. Gbajabiamila announced members of the panel as including the Chairman of the House’ Ad Hoc Committee on PIB and Majority Whip of the House Mohammed Monguno  and six others as members They are Victor Nwokolo Ademorin Kuye Kingley Uju Tijjani Yusuf Ibahim Hamza and Mansur Soro. On Wednesday when asked if the joint committee of both chambers would consider issues raised by the southern governors and other stakeholders a member of the panel who spoke to one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity  said the lawmakers would only concern themselves with resolving the differences in the versions passed. He stated “Conference committees are meant to harmonise differences reached by two chambers. So if this (Senate and House’ 3%\/5% disparity) is the only difference that is it.” But the House hit hard at critics of the PIB and described opposition to the bill provisions on host communities as hasty and propelled by lack of in-depth analysis. The Chairman of the House Committee on Media and Public Affairs Benjamin Kalu in a statement made available to one of our correspondents dismissed the controversy over the definition of ‘host communities.” According to Kalu states hosting production facilities of international oil companies are also considered as host communities. The note  was titled ‘The Petroleum Industry Bill 2020: A Simplified Explanation to the Constituents of Bende Federal Constituency by Rep. Benjamin Okezie Kalu Member Representing Bende Federal Constituency of Abia State and the Spokesman of the House of Representatives.’ Kalu said “On the 1st of July 2021 both chambers of the parliament went through the clause by clause consideration of the bill in preparation for the third reading which was a major achievement although not without a call from the public to explain grey areas appearing discriminatory to the host communities while claiming that a section of the nation is set up to benefit from both the Host Community Trust Fund as well as the Frontier Exploration Fund.” The lawmaker said he considered the opposition as “a hasty conclusion propelled by the lack of an in-depth analysis of the bill.” Kalu said “In Section 318 under the interpretation section ‘host community’ is defined as those communities situated in or appurtenant to the area of operation of a settlor and any other community as a settlor may determine pursuant to chapter 3 of the bill. “These are those communities housing the production assets of the settlors (the IOCs) and are compensated for the loss of surface use of land for exploration after the land survey is carried out. “The IOCs know their hosts at all times. There is zero ambiguity on this as no settlor will accept to fund those who are not hosting them. Surely the IOCs have a role to play in determining this especially when one looks at the provisions of the bill with regard to the host Community Trust Fund and the process of setting up the organisational structure as well as the implementation guidelines as outlined by the bill. Nigerians are assured that the Trust Fund will take care of the host communities to the exclusion of all others. “Pipeline routes are not host communities they are impacted communities under the care of the operators in the course of their operations. It is still not obvious which part of the bill mandated the Host Community Trust Fund to cater for the needs of the ‘impacted communities.’ These divisive propagandist theories should be ignored fully.” The House spokesman noted that what the executive sponsored bill proposed was an annual contribution of 2.5 per cent of the operating expenditure of the preceding year of the IOCs to fund this as provided for in Section 240(2) which the House amended based on technical advice to 5 per cent though the host communities asked for 10 per cent. “The reason behind our decision is to ensure that the financial burden is not much on the investors in this era of great competition across the sector. Since the desire of every investor in choosing the destinations for investment is majorly profit it presupposes that for our bargaining to be attractive it should create value for the investors to energise their buy-in. The point remains we can’t fund the whole nine yards of exploration and production without foreign direct investments. Several members of the House declined to speak on the record over the controversial clauses. Some members especially from the southern part of the country said copies of the report on the PIB were distributed late to lawmakers. “The document is voluminous and some of us received the report on the morning of the day it was to be considered. No one could have seen all the loopholes within the short period” a member from the South-East said. In the Senate a member of the panel told one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity that the committee met on Wednesday. He said members only deliberated on the issue of five per cent equity share for the host communities passed by the House of Representatives and the three per cent approved in the Senate. He said “ When there is a conference committee the essence is to reconcile only the areas where there are differences in the bill passed by both chambers. “At the moment  there are no other areas of disagreement apart from the oil equity share. While Senate approved 3 per cent the House passed 5 per cent. “During our meeting today (Wednesday) some of our members suggested that we adopt the House decision of 5 per cent while others said jerking the Senate version up from 3 to 4 per cent would be okay. “ From the look of things the Senate Committee would canvass 4 per cent oil equity share during our joint conference meeting with the House of Representatives. “We won’t be able to touch other clauses because they are no differences in the Senate and House versions.” The President of the Senate Dr Ahmad Lawan had on Tuesday said the panel would meet with their counterparts in the House of Representatives as early as possible to reconcile the differences in the two versions passed. The Senate President said the conference committee would start sitting immediately so that the National Assembly could transmit the harmonised the bill to the President. Lawan charged members of the conference committee to meet with their counterparts in the House of Representatives to enable the National Assembly to come up with a final document on the PIB for transmission to the Executive arm of government. He had said “The conference committee will meet with our counterparts in the House the House will also announce the composition of the conference committee. “We hope that they will swing into action immediately so that we are able to have the final document of the PIB which we will transmit for the presidential assent. “So we expect our delegation here under the leadership of the Senate Leader to engage with our colleagues in the House of Representatives.” The PUNCH had on Tuesday reported that the National Assembly might transmit the PIB passed by both chambers of the federal Parliament to the President for assent next week. A principal officer of the Senate who spoke with The Punch on conditions of anonymity on Monday had confirmed that the Senate and the House of Representatives would harmonise their different positions on the Bill latest by Tuesday next week. The Senator had  said the conference committee of the two chambers which would harmonise the two versions of the bill would start sitting before the end of the week. He had said “It is just that people love to play politics with everything. This is not the first time that the Senate and the House of Representatives would pass different versions of a Bill. “The usual conference committee would be constituted this week to harmonise the different versions and they are likely to submit their report early next week. “We are going on our annual recess on July 15th and we would transmit the bill to the President before we go on vacation. Both the Senate and the House of Representative’s leaderships have said so on number of occasions.” The Pan Niger Delta Forum in its reaction insisted that there was no going back on the rejection of the three per cent for host communities. It also reiterated its rejection of the five per cent okayed by the House of Representatives. PANDEF National Publicity Secretary Ken Robinson said this on telephone to our correspondent on Wednesday. This is as Robinson took a swipe on the House Chairman on Media and Publicity Benjamin Kalu on his remarks on the Petroleum Industry Bill. He said “PANDEF is amazed at the comments of one Hon. Benjamin Kalu who is representing  Bende Federal Constituency in Abia State. “We have also rejected the fraudulent and provocative 30 per cent of profits that have been designated for frontier exploration funds. “But for us we are rejecting the insults and we are saying that we will resist it. Our people we are talking and consulting and we will respond appropriately to the disrespect being meted out to the Niger Delta people by the National Assembly and its leadership and by the Nigerian state” he added.    Copyright PUNCH.

Confirming this to journalists the Commander-General Hisbah Board Sheikh Harun Ibn Sina stated that the children were evacuated from the streets following an undercover operation carried out by Hisbah personnel in the metropolis. According to him the majority of the children who claimed to have sneaked into Kano from neighbouring states and villages confessed that they depended on begging as a means of livelihood and survival. The commander-general disclosed that adequate arrangements were being made to reunite the children with their families as the Kano State Government had outlined measures to stamp out street begging. In addition Ibn Sina stated that as part of efforts to protect children the state government had forwarded a draft Child Protection Bill to the state House of Assembly to guarantee the rights of children against all forms of child labour and molestation. “The Kano State Hisbah Board is calling on parents as Allah (SAW) has appointed them as custodians as about 20 underage children were found living under the bridges in markets and motor parks. They roam from street to street in search of means of livelihood; they don’t go to school as they live freely without any supervision” he stated. During an interview with some of the children they pleaded for leniency and expressed the desire to be reunited with their families. “We sleep together in markets; sometimes we move to motor parks and under bridges. We beg for money to procure food so as to keep our bodies and souls together; and sometimes carry bulky goods for customers to their vehicles or homes for pittance” one of them said. Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"242","headline":"LASIEC shouldn’t have access to INEC voter register –Resident","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/lasiec-shouldnt-have-access-to-inec-voter-register-resident","stories":"The Federal High Court Ikoyi Lagos has threatened to deny the Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission access to the Independent National Electoral Commission register for Lagos voters ahead of the July 24 local government poll. The judge in charge of the suit marked FHC\/L\/CS\/677\/2021 Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke gave LASIEC seven days to show a reason why it should not grant a prayer by an All Progressives Congress chairmanship aspirant Raheem Alani who sought to restrain INEC from accessing the register for the 20 Local Government Areas. In a bench ruling Justice Aneke held “Being an ongoing election matter I shall give the defendant\/respondent seven days within which the defendant shall show reasons why the order should not be made against them.” Justice Aneke made the ruling after Alani’s ex parte motion which was argued through his counsel Tope Alabi seeking four reliefs. Alani a registered voter and a resident of Agege LGA is the plaintiff\/applicant while INEC and LASIEC are the 1st and 2nd defendants in the suit. Alani argued in his affidavit of urgency that LASIEC ought to conduct the election in accordance with the constitutionally recognised LGAs in Lagos State and not based on the 57 Local Council Development Areas created by the state which it intends to use. Alani stated “I know that the 57 LCDAs where the 2nd defendant intends to conduct elections are a product of the unconstitutional ‘balkanisation’ of the 20 constitutionally-recognised LGAs in Lagos State. By ‘balkanisation’ I mean that many of us have been excluded from Agege LGA and put within the unconstitutionally created Orile-Agege LCDA. “This means I would be denied the right to vote or be voted for as well as be robbed of voting to elect the chairman of Agege LGA or to be elected as its chairman.” Alani then prayed the court for an order restraining INEC from giving submitting or making the register available to LASIEC for its use in the chairmanship and councillorship elections based on the 57 LGAs and LCDAs or any other number of LGAs in excess of the 20 LGAs pending the determination of the motion. He also prayed the court for an order restraining INEC from giving LASIEC any logistical support for the elections based on the 57 LGAs and LCDAs as well as an order stopping LASIEC from preparing for the polls based on the 57 LCDAs. After giving his ruling Justice Aneke adjourned the case till July 14 2021. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

This is contained in a communiqué issued at the end of the fifth meeting of the forum in Jalingo the Taraba State capital. In the communiqué signed by the Chairman of the forum and Governor of Borno State Prof Babagana Zulum the body lamented the encumbrances which had stall the take-off of the project and called on the President to establish a special purpose vehicle to ensure the realisation of the project. The communiqué read in part “The forum deliberated extensively on the Mambilla hydroelectric power project and noted with dismay that the project as important as it is to Nigeria and the North-East sub-region is surrounded by a lot of contractual encumbrances which have stalled its take-off and realisation. “The forum therefore calls on the President to accord the project the desired seriousness it deserves by establishing a Special Purpose Vehicle to address the encumbrances and bring the project to reality.” While applauding the Federal Government and the military for the general improvement of security in the region the forum called for continuous collaboration of all the security agencies in the country to sustain the gains. The forum also appreciated the support of the diplomatic community in assisting in the humanitarian crisis in the region and called on donor agencies to activate the process of transiting from humanitarian to stabilisation of the region. It added “The transition from humanitarian intervention to stabilisation will ensure sustainability and give people the opportunity to help themselves out of poverty. “This will address the socio-economic dimension of insecurity in the region.” On the activities of the Northeast Development Commission the forum expressed deep concern that the lack of consultation between the commission and the various state governments on project priorities and locations had slowed down the level of intervention in the region. In a bid to reposition the education sector in the region the governors received and adopted the report of the advisory council on the improvement of quality education and performance of students in external examinations and teachers’ training.

{"id":"249","headline":"Currency in circulation falls by N65.74bn in four months","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/currency-in-circulation-falls-by-n65-74bn-in-four-months","stories":"The currency in circulation fell by N65.74bn to N2.741tn at the end of June from N2.81tn in March the latest figures from the Central Bank of Nigeria showed on Wednesday. According to the CBN the currency in circulation which stood at N2.796tn at the end of April fell to N2.791tn in May. The CBN defined the currency in circulation as currency outside the vaults of the central bank – that is all legal tender currency in the hands of the general public and in the vaults of the Deposit Money Banks. The CBN said it employed the “accounting\/statistical\/withdrawals & deposits approach” to compute the currency in circulation in Nigeria. It said this approach involved tracking the movements in currency in circulation on a transaction-by-transaction basis. According to the CBN for every withdrawal made by a Deposit Money Bank at one of CBN’s branches an increase in CIC is recorded; and for every deposit made by a DMB at one of CBN’s branches a decrease in CIC is recorded. The transactions are all recorded in the CBN’s CIC account and the balance on the account at any point in time represented the country’s currency in circulation. On the performance of monetary aggregates the CBN said broad money supply grew by 1.15 per cent in April 2021 compared with 0.04 per cent in March 2021. This development was largely driven by growth in net domestic assets while net foreign assets contracted. The growth in net domestic assets reflected the growth in aggregate credit supported by the ongoing broad-based monetary and fiscal stimulus the CBN said. It said gross banking sector credit at the end of March 2021 stood at N23.53tn compared to N22.68tn at the end of December 2020. The bank said this represented an increase of N0.85tn (year-to-date) of which commercial and merchant banks disbursed (N0.66tn) microfinance banks (N0.13tn) development finance institutions (N0.05tn) and primary mortgage banks and finance companies (N0.01tn). It said the liquidity condition in the banking system in the review period was determined by several factors including fiscal disbursements and withdrawals by states and local governments periodic CRR debits foreign exchange interventions open market operations and maturing CBN bills the net effect of which imposed liquidity constraints on the banking system.  Copyright PUNCH.

Kennedy noted that the entire industry continued to face strong headwinds including the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. He spoke on Wednesday during a panel discussion at the Nigeria Oil and Gas Conference & Exhibition in Abuja according to a statement. He said the global community had continued to scale up the collaboration towards lowering carbon emissions. “Chevron supports global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and is actively investing in operations to improve environmental performance while also working with industry to develop new innovative technology and best practices to achieve these objectives” Kennedy said. He said the company planned to spend some millions of dollars in 2021 to advance projects in key focus areas namely energy efficiency flare reductions venting and fugitive reductions renewables as well as carbon capture utilisation and storage. “Chevron has joined other energy companies supporting the Methane Guiding Principles to reduce methane emissions from natural gas exploration and production operations through digital innovation and deployment of best practices” he added. He said the NNPC\/CNL Joint Venture had progressively reduced routine gas flaring by over 95 per cent in the past 10 years and had remained ahead in terms of maximising supply of on-spec gas into the Nigerian domestic market. While commending the Nigerian government for the efforts in pursuing legislations for the industry he stressed the need for the legislations policies and regulations to bolster investor confidence and to be globally competitive to protect existing investments unlock opportunities and help reduce the cost premium of operating in Nigeria. According to Kennedy the legislation should assure investor confidence by resolving legacy debt establishing gas pricing that is competitive and covers the cost of development and operations and improving security for people and assets.

OGSPAN said in a statement that the planned imposition of VAT on LPG would stifle demand utilisation investment and growth of the sector in the country. The National President OGSPAN Mr Colman Obasi said “As a stakeholder in the sector we were delighted when the Federal Government previously excluded operators in the LPG sector from paying VAT. “We were even more delighted when it declared January 1 2021 to December 31 2030 as ‘The Decade of Gas Development for Nigeria’ with emphasis on LPG. However having taken these steps we were shocked to learn that the Federal Government is currently considering imposing VAT targeted at increasing its revenue.” According to the association a Presidential directive was issued on July 11 2005 to remove VAT on LPG but the approved memo erroneously had the word ‘import’ left on it because imports were the only source of gas at the time. Obasi said “This meant that the Federal Inland Revenue Service charged VAT on locally produced LPG but there was no output VAT so the VAT cost was absorbed as a loss by industry players. “Industry operators fought for 14 years to reverse this situation and the Minister of Finance finally removed the VAT on ‘domestically produced gas’ under a gazette issued in 2019 thus stopping the FIRS from charging VAT on LPG under a loophole that was created in error.” He added “The FIRS itself under several subsequent letters (now available in the public domain) advised companies that neither input nor output VAT was payable on LPG in line with other petroleum products. “Industry operators and experts had warned at the time that insertion of the phrase ‘locally produced’ in front of LPG would lead to the reverse case through this legal loophole and yet again another round of needless quagmire. “Experts have repeatedly pointed out that of all the petroleum products listed in that gazette ‘why was LPG singled out for the phrase ‘locally produced’; why not gasoline and diesel which we don’t produce and yet import over 100 times more quantity than LPG.” Obasi noted that the LPG sector had suffered from many problems including policy inconsistency inadequate funding and low domestic utilisation which he said needed to be fully addressed by the current administration. He said the planned introduction of VAT on LPG could reverse the gains already made in the Federal Government Gas Expansion Programme targeted at achieving rapid development of the sector.

{"id":"308","headline":"Restoration of General Buhari","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/restoration-of-general-buhari","stories":"When curators choose to restore (usually) valuable artifact to its old glory it is said to be restored. So it will be with the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) who is gradually going back to his old military self. After a chequered enviable career as a war officer military commander Minister of Petroleum Resources and Military Governor of Northeastern State Buhari became Head of the military junta that ousted the democratically elected government of President Shehu Shagari. Buhari had announced “In pursuance of the primary objective of saving our great nation from total collapse I Major General Muhammadu Buhari of the Nigerian Army have after due consultation amongst the services of the armed forces been formally invested with the authority of the Head of the Federal Military Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” But in a speech after his overthrow months later Chief of Army Staff Major General Ibrahim Babangida painted the picture of a man who was not a good team player an autocrat who does not take the counsel of significant others. Babangida alleged “The principles of discussions consultation and co-operation which should have guided decision-making process of the Supreme Military Council and the Federal Executive Council were disregarded soon after the government settled down in 1984.” The testimony of military peers who elected him as Head of State is that General Buhari was unhinged like a needle with no thread. He and his deputy Brig Tunde Idiagbon styled Chief of Staff Supreme Headquarters became the proverbial dogs that didn’t hear the whistle of the hunter. When they were overthrown in a palace coup Nigerians who dreaded their regime because of its high handedness abuse of fundamental human and media rights execution of drug couriers with a retroactive decree and implementation of unimaginative economic policies rejoiced. But after the disgraceful exit of military dictator Babangida his successor who criminally annulled the freest and fairest presidential election in Nigeria another military despot General Sani Abacha repented and appointed Buhari as Executive Chairman of Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund. The PTF was an omnibus intervention agency for roads waterways educational infrastructure  healthcare facilities food and water supplies using excess revenue from sale of crude oil above the benchmark price. It was the precursor of today’s Excess Crude Account the federation purse that warehouses excess crude oil revenue above benchmark price on behalf of the Federal Government state governments and local government authorities. Buhari who needed political rehabilitation and restoration accepted to serve under an officer who was several notches below him as a mere General Officer Commanding when he was military Head of State. Abacha was gracious in offering the condescending appointment though. He offered an apology on behalf of the group that ousted Buhari their Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. As Chairman of the PTF Buhari did his best though there were allegations of skewed execution of projects in Northern Nigeria. There were also unconfirmed allegations of mismanagement of resources. The rehabilitation and restoration may have informed Buhari’s quest to become a democratically elected President of Nigeria. Some sceptics however think it was only a bid to  spite and get even with Babangida. Three times 2003 2007 and 2011 Buhari contested Nigeria’s presidential election. He failed three times until he teamed up with the winning political machine of Bola Tinubu former Governor of Lagos State a man who transformed himself from a rookie politician to a master political strategist and tactician. After completing his two-term tenure as governor Tinubu decided against seeking any electoral office. He rather chose to extend his political franchise beyond Lagos State by installing governors in other South-West states as well as the South-South. To convince Nigerians and Western metropolitan powers that he would uphold the tenets of democracy Buhari showed up at the Chattam House British Royal Institute of International Affairs a policy think-tank set up to secure a prosperous and just world-a euphemism for free market economy and democracy. Buhari told his audience “Before you is a former military ruler and a converted democrat who is ready to operate under democratic norms and is subjecting himself to the rigours of democratic elections for the fourth time.” He won the presidential election with his posturing as a “born again” democrat and was accordingly inaugurated President on May 29 2015. He announced that he was for everybody and for nobody. But soon after he began to do the unexpected. First he elected to work only with civil servants before unnecessarily delaying when he finally succumbed to pressures to appoint ministers. When it looked like he was ready to work he began to fall sick in quick succession. His Vice President Prof Yemi Osinbajo swiftly took charge on each occasion and delivered good governance. But to the consternation of Nigerians the President reversed nearly all the positive decisions that Osinbajo took. Little did Nigerians know that their President would finally bare his fangs and return to his old self. Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka derisively wonders if a tiger could change its tigritude and Buhari has clearly shown that his leopard cannot change its spots. It was difficult for him to release Col Sambo Dasuki National Security Adviser to former President Goodluck Jonathan from police custody after the courts ordered his release on bail several times over. His nepotism surfaced when he argued for extension of railway lines from Kano to Maradi when he disclosed that he had first cousins in Niger Republic a country with $12.97 billion Gross Domestic Product. He neglected to build the Calabar-Lagos railway line that should serve a GDP in excess of $300 billion. A former military Head of State who became an elected President and a former Chief of Army Staff who later became Minister for Defence accused him or his government of being an ethnic champion. He hasn’t tried to shake off that perception. Just as 13 members of his 1984 Supreme Military Council were from Northern Nigeria with only five from the South an overwhelming number of heads of security agencies in his current regime are from Northern Nigeria– and he has no apologies whatsoever. And the soldier under his babariga is sneaking out in bits and the fist of mail is peering out of the velvet glove. To rework a phrase from American President Ronald Reagan “(Nigerians) ain’t seen nothing yet!” In the recent “capture” and return of Nnamdi Kanu leader of separatist Indigenous People of Biafra to Nigeria Buhari reenacted the attempted abduction of Umaru Dikko by his military regime at Stansted Airport in England. A few days after that he pulled an astonishing stunt that must have stunned his Western admirers by sending Department of State Services personnel to sack the home of Yoruba nation advocate Sunday “Igboho” Adeyemo. While the DSS admitted to arresting 12 of Adeyemo’s stalwarts and killing two others whose bodies they allegedly took away unconfirmed accounts suggest that the dead may be up to eight. Only one dead “Adogan” has been identified. If democratically elected President Buhari continuously conducts himself like military Head of State Buhari Prof Soyinka may once again describe his government as deaf. – Twitter @lekansote1 Copyright PUNCH.

A member of the rescue team however lost his life while one of those rescued sustained gunshot injury in the shootout between the abductors and security men. Recall that an unspecified number of passengers travelling in a commercial vehicle were abducted near Osun Bridge in Imesi Ile on Monday. Also at another location in Esa Odo town on Monday some passengers were abducted by gunmen. It was learnt that a combined team compromising policemen members of Hunters Group of Nigeria men of Kiriji Heritage Defenders and Oodua Peoples Congress narrowed the search for the victims to a forest in Ere Ijesa and tracked them a point before Osun Bridge. A source close to the scene said the search paid off when the man negotiating for ransom on behalf of the kidnappers was sighted by the search team who chased him to the spot where the victims were kept. The source further said “Interestingly the abductors six of them bearing AK-47 and pump action rifles and a man that was negotiating for ransom on their behalf kept the victims not far away from a police checkpoint. “The negotiator was tracked down and he ran towards where the victims were kept. “The other members of the kidnap gang then opened fire on the team and a member of OPC that was part of the rescue team was shot dead. One of those abducted also sustained injury while three of the abductors were also seriously injured. “All the victims are male and they have been taken to the Ibokun Police Area Command.” The Osun State Commissioner of Police Wale Olokode said four of the victims were rescued. “Unfortunately one person a member of OPC that was part of the rescue team was shot dead. One other person was also injured. Our men are still after the kidnappers” Olokode said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The British government had clarified that Nnamdi Kanu who was travelling with a British passport was not arrested within its shores. IPOB had accused the Buhari regime of abducting its leader in an East African country a claim confirmed by Kanu’s attorney Ifeanyi Ejiofor who accused Kenya’s special police force of arresting and torturing him before he was handed over to the Nigerian government. Meanwhile Kenya High Commissioner to Nigeria Wilfred Machage had refuted claims that Kanu was arrested in the country. But the UK Parliament in a parliamentary schedule posted on its website said it will set aside a debate on Wednesday July 7 to discuss the British government’s assessment of Kenya’s role in Mr. Kanu’s arrest. According to the document Lord Alton of Liverpool will be raising the issue at the House of Lords and will query the government on the separatist leader’s transfer to Nigeria. “Lord Alton of Liverpool to ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment they have made of (1) the alleged role of the government of Kenya in the detention and alleged mistreatment of Nigerian activist Nnamdi Kanu (2) the circumstances surrounding the transfer of Mr. Kanu to Nigeria against his will and (3) of any assistance being provided to him by the High Commission in Abuja. HL1665” the document read.  Meanwhile the President of the Nigerian Bar Association Mr Olumide Akpata has disowned comments made by the 1st Vice President of the association Mr John Aikpokpo-Martins. Aikpokpo-Martins was quoted to have said the President of Nigeria was constitutionally bound to crush secessionist agitators in Nigeria. But Akpata in a statement said “The views expressed by the first Vice President are his personal views which he posted on his Facebook account in the course of an online exchange and that the said views do not represent the position of the NBA on the subject.” Similarly the Presidency has commended security agencies involved in the re-arrest and repatriation Kanu and the raid on the residence of Yoruba nation activist Sunday Adeyemo aka Igboho. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Garba Shehu said this in a statement titled ‘Presidency Statement on the Recent Successes of Security and Intelligence Agencies’ in Abuja on Tuesday. The statement reads partly “Last week we saw the enhanced collaboration of the Nigerian law enforcement agencies as they executed with great synchronisation arrests of individuals who had inflicted pain and hardships on fellow citizens.” Shehu who recounted Kanu’s alleged offences said “By this singular action of our security forces sanity calm and peace have been returned to our communities.” Speaking on last Thursday’s raid on the residence of Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo the Presidency said assault weapons are not tools of peace-loving people and as such the security agencies would treat all bearers of small arms the same.

The acting Chairman of the committee Sada Soli made the call at an investigative hearing in Abuja on Tuesday. According the committee the money was recovered from Keystone Bank and deposited into the Federal Government Recovery Account domiciled with Central Bank of Nigeria. The Managing Director of Keystone Bank Lawal Ahmed said the new management of the bank had since taking charge “transferred part of the money in four tranches into the NNPC’s TAS account with the CBN.” The committee also resolved to place the sums of N356m and N1.1bn promissory notes transferred by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria on status inquiry. In his presentation AMCON’s Head of Enforcement Mr. Usman Abubakar noted that the two promissory notes were wrongfully issued in favour of EFCC and was rejected. He however noted that EFCC returned the promissory notes to DMO which acceded to issue fresh promissory notes in favour of AMCON in the sums of N328m and N866m. The committee therefore directed AMCON’s representative to “forward copies of the promissory notes re-issued to it by DMO.” The committee also resolved to “investigate the actual amount recovered by the presidential panel based on the N35bn recovered on behalf of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria against the N43bn worth of post-dated cheques issues by some of the debtors.” The FMBN in the documents submitted to the committee showed that the sum of N15.3bn was recovered by the SPIP.   Copyright PUNCH.

The President of the Miango Youths Development Association Mr Ezekiel Bini said  “ It was a  miracle that the district head escaped.

{"id":"332","headline":"Kaduna Baptist school invaders demand rice others to feed victims hold 121 students","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/kaduna-baptist-school-invaders-demand-rice-others-to-feed-victims-hold-121-students","stories":"Bandits who invaded Maraban Rido in the Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Monday and abducted some students of the Bethel Baptist High School Damishi have reached out to the management of the institution to demand foodstuffs. The PUNCH learnt that the hoodlums asked for food items such as rice beans seasoning and oil to feed the students. A member of the school management who confided in one of our correspondents on Tuesday stated that the bandits said 121 students of the school were in their custody. According to the school official the bandits first called on Monday and allowed one of the students to speak to a top member of the school management. It was learnt that they called again on Tuesday and allowed two senior students a boy and a girl to speak to a top official of the school. It was gathered that the senior students confirmed that there were 121 of them with the bandits. The official who confided in The PUNCH said “When the phone rang the bandits first spoke to the member of the management. They said a senior student was directed to count the students in their custody and the boy confirmed that 121 students were being held. They also asked for food such as rice and beans as well oil to feed the students. “Later the senior student who counted the abductees said there were 121 of them with the bandits.” The management of the school and parents of the abducted students met on Tuesday on ways to rescue the abductees. This was just as the school management confirmed that 121 students were being held by the bandits. The proprietor of the school who is also the President Kaduna Baptist Conference Rev Ishaya Jangado made the confirmation. The meeting lasted several hours amidst threat by the parents to embark on another round of protest and block the Kaduna-Kachia Highway where the school is located. The parents mostly women had indeed blocked the highway before operatives of the Kaduna State Vigilante Service prevailed on them to abandon the protest. The parents also held a prayer session for God’s intervention in the rescue of their children from the kidnappers’ den. Shortly after that Jangado confirmed to newsmen that no fewer than 121 students were in the custody of the kidnappers. He said 28 students were “recovered” on Monday after the bandits attacked the school. He explained that the total number of students in the boarding house was 154 and that 28 were recovered while 121 were in the bandits’ custody. He however did not provide any explanation on the remaining five students. He said “For now we know that we have 154 students in the school hostel and yesterday (Monday) after the exchange of fire between the soldiers and the bandits we came to the school and recovered 28 students; some of them were hit in many places. In the course of being taken away some of them escaped and they came back to the school. “So the total number of students we recovered yesterday (Monday) was 28 and today (Tuesday) by the grace of God we got a call from the bandits and they assured us that our children are well and doing okay. “In fact we had the privilege of speaking with a few of them. They counted themselves in the jungle and they gave us information that they were 121 and when we put the number together with what we have recovered we discovered that the number is exactly the same as the number of students we have in the hostel.” ‘No we were caught unawares’ Facts emerged on Tuesday on how the bandits wrote the management on their intention to attack the school. A parent who confided in one of our correspondents said the bandits actually notified the management that they were coming to attack the school. The warning the parent said was ignored by both the guardian of the boys’ hostel and matron of the girls’ hostel when the students took the letter to them. She said the teachers taunted the students for being eager to go home for holiday. She stated “The bandits actually wrote the school a letter on Sunday that they were going to attack it on Tuesday before striking on Monday. “The students took the letter to their guardian and he said to them that they didn’t want to be in school and that they were trying to look for an excuse to leave school. “They took the same letter and gave it to the matron of the girls’ hostel; she also acted the same way.  The children in their innocence believed them and never said anything until the bandits struck on Monday. The bandits notified the school of their coming but the students acted otherwise.” However Jangado dismissed the claim saying it was a pure lie. He said the bandits took the school management unawares. “That is a serious lie. That is wrong. These people (bandits) took us unawares because we have our plans on security matters how we can ensure that the students write their exams and go. So there was no letter or any information about their coming” he stated. He also said the management of the school would be willing to seek out any individual including the controversial Islamic cleric Sheikh Ahmad Gumi for intervention to secure the release of the students. When asked if he would seek Gumi’s intervention Jangado said “Well if something is burning in your hand whatever you can touch to make your hands cold you will touch it. “Whosoever will come to our rescue the person is welcome. All the parents are crying about is for their children to come back. So whosoever can intervene to make the children come back the person is welcome.” On if the management would seek the support of the National Baptist Conference the national body of the church in Nigeria Jangado noted that the body would be informed of the attack but it would not be involved in negotiation or payment of ransom should the need arise. One of our correspondents who visited the school premises on Tuesday was told how the bandits tricked the students to follow them into the bush. According to a source when the bandits succeeded in breaking into the school through “the broken perimeter fence” they headed straight for the boys’ hostel and deceived the students that they were military personnel on a mission to rescue them from bandits. He said “When they entered the various hostels one of the bandits spoke in English to the students that they were on a mission to rescue them from bandits. He said bandits were on the way to the school to attack them. The bandits asked the students to come out and follow them. It was after they came out that they sensed that something was wrong and those who could escape did so and others were taken away.” Nigeria under the watch of the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) has become a wasteland devouring its inhabitants the Christian Association of Nigeria has said. The body also called on the international community to assist Nigeria as it did for Syria to fight nationwide banditry and insecurity. The President of CAN and immediate-past President of the Nigerian Baptist Convention Dr Samson Ayokunle said this in a statement while reacting to the kidnapping of 121 students of the Bethel Baptist College Kaduna. Ayokunle said the situation in Kaduna State “has become quite terrible because of the uncouth unbridled and acidic statements credited to Governor Nasir El-Rufai who appears to be talking too much than acting!” According to him Buhari should caution El-Rufai against making reckless statements. The statement read in part “It is a sin and a crime against humanity to have zero regards for the lives of others or be unable to provide security for citizens. “Kidnapping and abduction are now a thriving business in Nigeria and it is almost becoming synonymous with the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. It is very evident by each passing hour that this present administration is just paying lip service to the issues of security. “Whereas provision of adequate security for all Nigerian citizens was one of the campaign promises of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015\/2019 general elections and the major reason people voted for him was being an ex-military man the administration has failed woefully to keep campaign promises.” The Secretary-General of the Nigeria Union of Teachers Dr Mike Ene on Tuesday urged the Federal Government to implement the Safe Schools Initiative programme to end the spate of abductions in schools especially in Kaduna State. Ene made the appeal in an interview with The PUNCH in Abuja. He lamented the rising spate of abduction of school children across Nigeria. Ene noted that the implementation of the Safe School Initiative which was the brainchild of the President Goodluck Jonathan administration in 2014 would go a long way in reducing if not eliminating the crime especially in Kaduna State which he noted had become an epicentre of the schoolchildren abductions. Similarly a UNESCO education specialist who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said the organisation was working with the Federal Ministry of Education and the North East Development Council to deal with the situation. The source said “We are making sure that we transfer students from the BAY (Borno Adamawa and Yobe states) to schools in other areas. “Most of the students who were transferred when the initiative was launched have graduated and the process still continues. We are working with the Education Ministry and the North East Development Council.” The remains of one of the military personnel killed by bandits while on a mission to rescue the abducted students have been laid to rest. The names of the slain personnel were given as Private Salisu Rabiu of the Nigerian Army and Ordinary Seaman Bilal Mohammed a naval rating. The state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan who stated this in a statement said while the remains of Mohammed were interred at the Ungwan Kanawa Cemetery Kaduna North LGA Rabiu’s corpse was taken to Daura Katsina State for interment. El-Rufai condoled with the families of the slain security operatives. The commissioner said “The governor of Kaduna State Malam Nasir El-Rufai has condoled with the families of two personnel of the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Navy who paid the supreme price on Monday while defending students of the Bethel Baptist High School Kaduna. “The two personnel Private Salisu Rabiu and Ordinary Seaman Bilal Mohammed lost their lives while engaging the bandits who attacked the school and kidnapped an unspecified number of students in the early hours of Monday July 5 2021.” Meanwhile the House of Representatives has condemned the growing insecurity in Nigeria especially the endless killings and kidnapping across the country.

The coalition accused the southern governors of shielding “felons arsonists and mass atrocity perpetrators in their midst by challenging the prerogative of the Federal Government to enforce law and order in all parts of the country.” The spokesperson for CNG Abdul-Azeez Suleiman in a statement said there had been a gang-up against the North in particular to force a regional shift of the Presidency in 2023 by whatever means and tactics. According to him the insistence by the southern governors on the anti-grazing law “aims to selectively imperil the business of cattle rearing and threaten the legitimate presence of pastoral communities in the south. The statement reads “The desperation of the southern governors to shield the assortment of criminals incite and carry out attacks and wanton destruction of lives and property of other citizens and national security assets has exposed the level of their complicity in the operations of the armed terrorist groups in the South.  “Their support for treasonable felony by the subtle endorsement of the activities of such criminal separatist forces led by the likes of Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu by warning the nation’s security agencies against operating in the region without obtaining permission from the governor of the particular state is a matter that must be given the seriousness it deserves.” “The northern group added that the governors resolutions on 2023 exposed a deliberate attempt to impose a contentious system of rotational presidency aimed at achieving dubious political goals to weaken the North. “This conspiracy is actively perpetrated with the connivance of some northerners and accommodated by the personal ambition of a few of those that present themselves as northern political leaders. “Inevitably the immediate trigger to the Lagos pronouncements was the collaborative assurances by the former Borno State Governor Kashim Shettima and the Kaduna State Governor Nasir Elrufai given just two days earlier” the statement added. On anti-grazing law the group called on the Federal Government to ensure that herders’ rights to freedom of movement was not impeded by any legislation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"337","headline":"Lack of guidelines stops NBC licence for Facebook Instagram others","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/lack-of-guidelines-stops-nbc-licence-for-facebook-instagram-others","stories":"• ECOWAS Court fixes date to consolidate Twitter ban suits NBA sues FG Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and other platforms have yet to register with the National Broadcasting Commission nearly one month after the Federal Government introduced a new policy asking all social media platforms and other over-the-top media to obtain a licence from the NBC The PUNCH has learnt. Following the suspension of Twitter on June 4 2021 the NBC had in an advertorial asked all social media platforms and online broadcasting service providers operating in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence. However after the NBC announced the new policy the Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed asked the House of Representatives to amend the NBC Act to empower the commission to regulate online platforms. The development is believed to have caused confusion in the agency as Mohammed’s statement implies that the NBC currently lacks the power to regulate online platforms. “The minister admitted before the House of Representatives that we need to be empowered by law to regulate online platforms but we have already gone ahead to start regulating them. Everything is just clumsy” a top NBC source said. The source said there was no licensing framework adding that the NBC also lacked the capacity for enforcement. The source stated “Sincerely speaking the decision to suspend Twitter was a knee-jerk reaction. The minister asked the NBC to regulate online platforms when we don’t even have the technology to do so. That was why we had to rely on the Nigerian Communications Commission to block Twitter’s URL. It is the NCC that regulates the Internet service providers and can block sites. “There are thousands of platforms that broadcast content into Nigeria. Is it all of them that will need to be licensed? If so how much will it cost? The government people using VPN will be prosecuted and then later they changed their mind. We seriously don’t know what is happening.” The Chief Executive Officer of IPI Mr Adamu Garba who created a social media app Crowwe told The PUNCH that he had applied for a licence from the NBC but the commission had failed to work on it for over three weeks. “I have gone twice to the NBC. We went last week and they said we should return on Monday which we did but then we were asked to return on Wednesday (today) which will be the third visit. The NBC has not released any guidelines and has not given us any feedback. There are a lot of things we don’t understand” Garba said. The Director Media NBC Gloria Makinde neither responded to calls nor a text message sent to her. Similarly an aide to the minister Segun Adeyemi did not respond to calls. Meanwhile Justice Olayinka Faji of the Federal High Court in Lagos has fixed July 23 2021 for hearing of a suit instituted by human rights lawyer Inibehe Effiong against the Twitter suspension. In the originating motion marked FHC\/L\/CS\/542\/2021 Effiong is seeking nine reliefs including an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Federal Government and its agents from further suspending deactivating or banning the operation and accessibility of Twitter or any other social media service in Nigeria. The Nigerian Bar Association has similarly sued the Federal Government for banning the microblogging platform Twitter. The National Publicity Secretary of the NBA Rapulu Nduka said this in a telephone interview with one of our correspondents in Abuja on Tuesday. According to him the matter came up for mention before Justice Fayi of the Federal High Court Lagos on Monday. “We have served the processes and the case was adjourned till July 23 2021” he said. In the suit marked FHC\/L\/CS\/613\/2021 the Incorporated Trustees of the NBA brought the action against the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami; the Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed; and the Nigerian Communications Commission as first to fourth defendants respectively. Similarly the Community Court of the Economic Community of West African States has fixed July 9 to decide on the consolidation of all applications before it on the Twitter ban by the Federal Government. The ECOWAS Court stated this in a virtual sitting held via Zoom on Tuesday. On the cause list for the day were two applications against the Federal Government over the Twitter ban. One was the application brought by the Registered Trustees of the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project against the Federal Government marked ECW\/CCJ\/APP\/23\/21. The other was the application brought by the Media Rights Agenda and eight others against the Federal Government on the same issue marked ECW\/CCJ\/APP\/29\/21. The lawyer representing the Federal Government Abdullahi Abubakar informed the court that he had a motion to consolidate all the four applications. In his motion on notice dated July 5 2021 Abubakar prayed for the leave of the court to consolidate the hearing of the applications and others that the court might deem fit in the circumstance. Counsel for SERAP Femi Falana SAN did not object to the application.   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

It was gathered that the students marched round the campus at Amassoma on Monday chanting solidarity songs and demanding the stoppage of the plan. The NDU management was said to have come up with the plan to curb what it termed indecent dressing especially among female students on campus. The placard-carrying undergraduates who continued the protest on Tuesday also condemned the closure of fees’ portal for old students and the continued ban on the activities of the Students’ Union Government which they said was a deliberate attempt to suppress student unionism. Some of the students who pleaded anonymity for fear of victimisation by the NDU management also called on Governor Douye Diri to sack the Vice-Chancellor of the institution Prof Samuel Edoumiekumo who is angling for a second tenure. The students described Edoumiekumo’s policies as ridiculous adding that the introduction of school uniforms was a sign of high-handedness and open tyranny. They alleged that engineering students would pay as much as N30000 each for their uniforms while students of other faculties would pay N20000 each. Edoumiekumo had in June come under attack over discrimination against a physically-challenged man who was a deputy bursar of the school which sparked a protest. The physically-challenged man was reportedly denied the opportunity of appearing for an interview for the position of bursar and remained suspended following the protest although Diri addressed the management on the development. The Public Relations Officer NDU Idoni Ingezi explained that “the closure of the fees portal is a policy of the school” but maintained that it was still open for this session. Ingezi denied the institution had fixed fees for uniforms saying that discussions were still ongoing at departmental levels.   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Speaking at the opening ceremony the Chairman of the forum and Governor of Borno State Prof Babagana Zulum said the meeting became necessary so as to advance regional cooperation to tackle the challenges of the region. He stated “Our coming together is to explore the opportunities available to the region and help solve the problems facing us. “I want to thank President Buhari for his visit to Borno recently where he received first hand information on how to solve one of the most challenging problems in the region – Boko Haram. While commending the troops over the renewed vigour in the fight Zulum urged them to take advantage of the current division in the ranks of the insurgents and defeat them totally.  “I want to urge troops to capitalise on the current division in the ranks of the insurgents and defeat them totally for a peaceful subregion” he said Earlier the host governor Darius Ishaku reminded his colleagues that the forum had become a strong political voice in Nigeria and urged them to always speak with one voice and support member states in solving the problems of the region. Ishaku called on the forum to garner support for the actualisation of the Mambilla hydro power project by lobbying the National Assembly and the Presidency to make budgetary provisions for the project even as he lamented that it received zero budgetary allocation in the 2021 budget. While calling for the harnessing of the agricultural potential in the region to boost its economy ensure food security and job creation Ishaku said Taraba State was blessed with arable land for the cultivation of various crops. He however lamented that conflicts between herders and farmers had affected the harnessing of the agricultural potential for the good of the state and the region. The governor stated “The displacement of people has led to a humanitarian crisis and Taraba has borne the burden of conflicts in the region. Today herders’ conflict has taken a toll on food security and high crime rate and we must work hard to address this challenge. “I want to thank President Buhari for the renewed fight against Boko Haram but I want to call on the Federal Government to fast-track the exploration of oil in the Lake Chad basin and the Benue trough for the good of the region and the nation” he said.

{"id":"396","headline":"Electoral Act amendment proposes oath-taking for INEC officials security agents","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/electoral-act-amendment-proposes-oath-taking-for-inec-officials-security-agents","stories":"The National Assembly has proposed removal of manual accreditation of voters for all elections in Nigeria. The Independent National Electoral Commission will be empowered to reschedule an election at a polling unit where a smart card reader fails to verify the identity of a voter card holder and the backup device also fails. The Act also proposed oath-taking for INEC officials and security agents. These are contained in the report on the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill billed for consideration and adoption by the Senate and House of Representatives. According to the report by the joint Senate and House Committees on INEC and Electoral Matters a new Section 47(3) will read “Where a smart card reader or any other technological device deployed for accreditation of voters fails to function in any particular unit and a fresh card reader or technological device is not deployed the election in that unit shall be cancelled and another election shall be scheduled within 24 hours if the commission is satisfied that the result of the election in that polling unit will substantially affect the final result of the whole election and declaration of a winner in the constituency concerned.” Presently voters are accredited manually where electronic verification fails. The Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2020 passed the second reading at the House on November 27 2020 while Chairman of the House Committee on Electoral Matters Aishatu Dukku had since February 23 2021 laid the report on a ‘Bill for an Act to Repeal the Electoral Act 2010 and Enact the Electoral Act 2021 to Regulate the Conduct of Elections in Federal States and Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory; and for Related Matters.’ At the public hearing Dukku had noted that the bill was put together by the Senate the House INEC and the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN). Other recommendations by the joint committee in the report a copy of which our correspondent obtained include prohibition of transfer or sale of voter cards. Section 22 of the bill reads “Any person including an entity who (a) is in illegal possession of any voter’s card whether issued in the name of any voter or not; (b) sells or offers to sell any voter’s card whether issued in the name of the voter or not; or (c) buys or offers to buy any voter’s card on whether his or her own behalf or in behalf of any other person; commits an offence and is liable on conviction to (i) in the case of an individual a fine not more than N2000000 or imprisonment for a term not more than two years or both and (ii) in the case of an entity a fine of N5000000.” Also Section 26(1) in the report (which was Section 28(1) in the bill) provides that all INEC staff members Electoral Officers Presiding Officers Returning Officers Security Officials “taking part in the conduct of an election shall affirm or swear to an oath of loyalty and neutrality indicating that they will not accept bribe or gratification from any person and shall perform their functions and duties impartially and in the interest of the Federal Republic of Nigeria without fear or favour. An analysis of the amounts proposed as the ceiling for respective posts showed that the National Assembly raised some of them by 200 per cent. For instance in Section 91 under Limitation on Election Expenses in the original bill the House had set the maximum election expenses to be incurred by a candidate for a presidential election at N5bn while governorship was pegged at N1bn; Senate and House membership N100m and N70m respectively; state House of Assembly N30m; chairmanship election in a Local Government Area or area council N30m; and councillorship in an area council N5m. However in 88 (1) of the report the joint committee recommended N15bn for presidential election; N5bn for governorship; N1.5bn and N500m for Senate and House membership respectively; N50m for state House of Assembly membership; N50m for LGA or Area Council chairmanship; and N5m for LGA or Area Council councillorship. In a related development the Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Monday told Nigerians that had been criticising the National Assembly over the ongoing amendments of the Electoral Act to channel their grievances to their representatives in the National Assembly as soon as possible. Lawan stated this while inauguration of the reconstituted Public Complaints Commission by the National Assembly led by the Chief Commissioner Abimbola Ayo-Yusuf. He said “The National Assembly is embarking on the amendment of the Electoral Act. (It will) probably (be passed) by next week. “It is very important that those who feel very strongly about any amendment that they think should be effected in the Act should contact or talk to their members of House of Representatives as well as distinguished senators. “I want to state categorically clear here that presiding officers are not the ones to determine what is coming or what is not. Lawan challenged Nigerians to utilise the newly reconstituted PCC to seek redress whenever their rights are trampled upon. Also speaking at the PCC inauguration the Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila described the PCC as “a product of necessity due to human rights abuses societal victimisation high headedness practices of maladministration.”  Meanwhile the Peoples Redemption Party has said it is “sad and seriously concerned” about the move to disallow electronic transmission of results in future elections in the country. The National Chairman of the PRP Falalu Bello in a statement issued on Monday and titled ‘Draft Electoral Bill: Three Steps Backwards’ called on Nigerians to mobilise against the planned removal by the National Assembly. Similarly a coalition of over 247 women groups on Monday protested against alleged manipulation of the final copy of the bill includinh the prohibition of electronic transmission of results and removal of the power of the INEC to review results declared under duress or in contravention of electoral laws. The gender groups statement was signed by the Executive Director of Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre and chairperson of Transition Monitoring Group Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi. Other signatories included 100 Women Lobby Group; Initiative for Girls Above ActionAid Nigeria Nigerian Women Trust Fund Women in Nigerian Politics and Women in Radio. The document reads partly “Some key provisions of the manipulated bill that are particularly worrying are the prohibition of electronic transmission of results (Section 50 (2)); the removal of INEC’s power to review results declared under duress or in contravention of electoral laws and guidelines (Section 65); and the drastic increase in the limits for campaign expenses.” “These provisions have the potential to undermine transparency and fairness in elections. This affects women disproportionately for two main reasons: Women rarely get the tickets for the ‘big parties’ and often their hope lies with the smaller parties.” Copyright PUNCH.

The union revealed that the agency was finding it difficult to pay salaries at some point this year after the secret engagement of the staff members within a period of 18 months. The NCSU in a letter to the FIRS Chairman Muhammad Nami dated June 21 2021 demanded an end to the re-engagement of retired directors and other categories of staff. The letter titled ’21 days’ ultimatum to FIRS management’ was signed by the Chairman NCSU-FIRS Unit Idris Abdulrahman; and the Secretary Idowu Jimoh respectively. It was copied to the Minister of Finance Nigeria Labour Congress Nigerian Civil Service Union NCSU Federal Council the FIRS board secretariat and all FIRS staff. The letter read in part “In compliance with extant provisions\/protocols on recruitment and career progression we demand the immediate stoppage of re-engagement of retired directors and other categories of staff. We have noted that timely payment of salaries was a challenge at some point in 2021 after discrete recruitment of over 2000 staff within a record period of less than 18 months.” The union attributed the dwindling revenue collection in the country to the ‘’untimely implementation of the tax pro-max application by the Federal Inland Revenue Service.” It said the implementation has had adverse effects on collections which ought to be high in June\/July from analysis of past records. While lauding the application which enables seamless registration filing and payment of taxes and automatic credit of withholding tax as well as other credits to the tax payers’ accounts the union faulted the timing of the implementation which it said coincided with the FIRS’ peak period for tax collection. The union therefore recommended that the application be done in phases while asking that the tax payers should be allowed to file both electronically and manually.  The NCSU also handed down a 21-day ultimatum to the management to meet its various demands including the payment of general performance bonus for collecting 98.6 per cent of the 2020 revenue target. But the FIRS spokesman Abdullahi Sumaila denied that the FIRS was finding it difficult to pay salaries adding that the agency has been paying salaries as and when due. “You would have seen protests if there was secret recruitment which is not true. All I know is that they have been paying salaries as and when due” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"420","headline":"Electoral Act amendment proposes oath taking for INEC officials security agents","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/electoral-act-amendment-proposes-oath-taking-for-inec-officials-security-agents","stories":"The National Assembly has proposed removal of manual accreditation of voters for all elections in Nigeria. The Independent National Electoral Commission will be empowered to reschedule an election at a polling unit where a smart card reader fails to verify the identity of a voter card holder and the backup device also fails. The Act also proposed oath-taking for INEC officials and security agents. These are contained in the report on the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill billed for consideration and adoption by the Senate and House of Representatives. According to the report by the joint Senate and House Committees on INEC and Electoral Matters a new Section 47(3) will read “Where a smart card reader or any other technological device deployed for accreditation of voters fails to function in any particular unit and a fresh card reader or technological device is not deployed the election in that unit shall be cancelled and another election shall be scheduled within 24 hours if the commission is satisfied that the result of the election in that polling unit will substantially affect the final result of the whole election and declaration of a winner in the constituency concerned.” Presently voters are accredited manually where electronic verification fails. The Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2020 passed the second reading at the House on November 27 2020 while Chairman of the House Committee on Electoral Matters Aishatu Dukku had since February 23 2021 laid the report on a ‘Bill for an Act to Repeal the Electoral Act 2010 and Enact the Electoral Act 2021 to Regulate the Conduct of Elections in Federal States and Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory; and for Related Matters.’ At the public hearing Dukku had noted that the bill was put together by the Senate the House INEC and the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN). Other recommendations by the joint committee in the report a copy of which our correspondent obtained include prohibition of transfer or sale of voter cards. Section 22 of the bill reads “Any person including an entity who (a) is in illegal possession of any voter’s card whether issued in the name of any voter or not; (b) sells or offers to sell any voter’s card whether issued in the name of the voter or not; or (c) buys or offers to buy any voter’s card on whether his or her own behalf or in behalf of any other person; commits an offence and is liable on conviction to (i) in the case of an individual a fine not more than N2000000 or imprisonment for a term not more than two years or both and (ii) in the case of an entity a fine of N5000000.” Also Section 26(1) in the report (which was Section 28(1) in the bill) provides that all INEC staff members Electoral Officers Presiding Officers Returning Officers Security Officials “taking part in the conduct of an election shall affirm or swear to an oath of loyalty and neutrality indicating that they will not accept bribe or gratification from any person and shall perform their functions and duties impartially and in the interest of the Federal Republic of Nigeria without fear or favour. An analysis of the amounts proposed as the ceiling for respective posts showed that the National Assembly raised some of them by 200 per cent. For instance in Section 91 under Limitation on Election Expenses in the original bill the House had set the maximum election expenses to be incurred by a candidate for a presidential election at N5bn while governorship was pegged at N1bn; Senate and House membership N100m and N70m respectively; state House of Assembly N30m; chairmanship election in a Local Government Area or area council N30m; and councillorship in an area council N5m. However in 88 (1) of the report the joint committee recommended N15bn for presidential election; N5bn for governorship; N1.5bn and N500m for Senate and House membership respectively; N50m for state House of Assembly membership; N50m for LGA or Area Council chairmanship; and N5m for LGA or Area Council councillorship. In a related development the Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Monday told Nigerians that had been criticising the National Assembly over the ongoing amendments of the Electoral Act to channel their grievances to their representatives in the National Assembly as soon as possible. Lawan stated this while inauguration of the reconstituted Public Complaints Commission by the National Assembly led by the Chief Commissioner Abimbola Ayo-Yusuf. He said “The National Assembly is embarking on the amendment of the Electoral Act. (It will) probably (be passed) by next week. “It is very important that those who feel very strongly about any amendment that they think should be effected in the Act should contact or talk to their members of House of Representatives as well as distinguished senators. “I want to state categorically clear here that presiding officers are not the ones to determine what is coming or what is not. Lawan challenged Nigerians to utilise the newly reconstituted PCC to seek redress whenever their rights are trampled upon. Also speaking at the PCC inauguration the Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila described the PCC as “a product of necessity due to human rights abuses societal victimisation high headedness practices of maladministration.”  Meanwhile the Peoples Redemption Party has said it is “sad and seriously concerned” about the move to disallow electronic transmission of results in future elections in the country. The National Chairman of the PRP Falalu Bello in a statement issued on Monday and titled ‘Draft Electoral Bill: Three Steps Backwards’ called on Nigerians to mobilise against the planned removal by the National Assembly. Similarly a coalition of over 247 women groups on Monday protested against alleged manipulation of the final copy of the bill includinh the prohibition of electronic transmission of results and removal of the power of the INEC to review results declared under duress or in contravention of electoral laws. The gender groups statement was signed by the Executive Director of Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre and chairperson of Transition Monitoring Group Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi. Other signatories included 100 Women Lobby Group; Initiative for Girls Above ActionAid Nigeria Nigerian Women Trust Fund Women in Nigerian Politics and Women in Radio. The document reads partly “Some key provisions of the manipulated bill that are particularly worrying are the prohibition of electronic transmission of results (Section 50 (2)); the removal of INEC’s power to review results declared under duress or in contravention of electoral laws and guidelines (Section 65); and the drastic increase in the limits for campaign expenses.” “These provisions have the potential to undermine transparency and fairness in elections. This affects women disproportionately for two main reasons: Women rarely get the tickets for the ‘big parties’ and often their hope lies with the smaller parties.” Copyright PUNCH.

Spokesman for the Ohanaeze Alex Ogbonnia who said the group backed the southern governors’ position that the region should produce the president in 2023 said the region must be magnanimous in conceding the presidency to South-East. The governors had met on Monday in Ikeja Lagos State to deliberate on the state of the nation. The meeting came eight weeks after their last meeting in May 11 2021 in Asaba Delta State where they banned open grazing and advocated restructuring among others. On Monday the governors declared support for rotational presidency saying the next president should come from the South. Rising from the meeting chairman of Southern Governors’ Forum and Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu read the communiqué agreed to by member states. He said “The forum reaffirms its commitment to the unity of Nigeria on the pillars of equity fairness justice progress and peaceful coexistence between and amongst its people. “The forum reiterates its commitment to the politics of equity fairness and unanimously agreed that the Presidency of Nigeria be rotated between southern and northern Nigeria and resolved that the next president of Nigeria should emerge from the south.” Regarding security southern governors Akeredolu said “The forum reviewed the security situation in the country and commended the security operatives for their relentless efforts in restoring security and safety. We commiserate with families and loved ones who have fallen in the line of duty. The forum re-emphasise the need for state police. The forum resolves that if for any reason security institutions need to undertake an operation in any state the state chief security officer must be duly informed. “The forum frowns at selective criminal administration of justice and resolved that arrests should be made within the ambit of the law and fundamental human rights. “The forum sets a timeline of Wednesday September 1 2021 for the promulgation of the anti open-grazing law in all its member states and resolves that funds deducted from the federation account for the Nigerian Police Security Trust Fund should be distributed among the states and Federal Government to combat security challenges.” The governors faulted the proposed shares from oil and gas revenue as spelt out by the Petroleum Industry Bill which was recently passed by the National Assembly. “The forum commends the National Assembly for the progress made in the passage of the PIB; the forum however rejects in very strong terms the proposed three per cent for host communities by the Senate and support five per cent share of the oil revenue to the host communities as recommended by the House of Representative. “The forum also rejects the proposed 30 per cent share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins. The forum rejects the ownership structure of the proposed Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation limited and disagree that the company is vested in the Federal Ministry of Finance. The forum proposed that the company should be held in trust by the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority since all tiers of government have stake in that vehicle.” The governors also faulted the removal or electronic transmission of election results from the Electoral Act and the exclusive jurisdiction wielded by the Federal High Court. “In order to consolidate our democracy and strengthen electoral process the Southern Governors Forum rejects the removal of electronic transmission of election results from the proposed Electoral Act and reject the confirmation of exclusive jurisdiction in pre-election matters on the Federal High Court” they stated. The forum announced that Lagos State would be its permanent secretariat.  Other governors who attended the meeting are Babajide Sanwo-Olu Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta) Nyensom Wike (Rivers) Dapo Abiodun (Ogun) Gboyega Oyetola (Osun) Emmanuel Udom (Akwa Ibom) Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti) Douye Diri (Bayelsa) Seyi Makinde (Oyo) and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu). Deputy Governors who represented their principals are Philip Shuaibu (Edo) Placid Njokwu (Imo) Ude Oko Chukwu (Abia) and Kelechi Igwe (Ebonyi). Governors of Cross River and Anambra states Prof. Ben Ayade and Willie Obiano were absent. Meanwhile Ohanaeze Ndigbo spokesman Ogbonnia commended the governors saying The truth is that there have been a gentleman agreement between rotation or alternation of the Presidency between the North and the South. “However in commending the southern governors for that resolution Ohanaeze is urging them to be magnanimous in conceding to South-East the Presidency. The South-West had a shot the South-South had a shot; and in each occasion the Igbo gave them total support. “So justice equity and fairness will demand that they concede the Presidency to the South-East. So in thanking them we are going step ahead to urge them to consider the South East to have a shot at the Presidency. On open grazing he said the September deadline was a welcome development adding “Ohanaeze will also urge the South East Governors to follow it up with action.” Meanwhile the Yoruba socio-cultural group Afenifere says the demand by southern governors for the South to produce the next President in 2023 is a welcome development. Afenifere however said its immediate priority is restructuring and not the 2023 polls. The leader of Afenifere Chief Ayo Adebanjo said this during a chat with The PUNCH on Monday. When asked if his group believes that the South should produce the next President Adebanjo said “I support it 100 per cent.” But when asked if Afenifere would be pressing for a South-West President the 93-year-old statesman said “We are not supporting any election until Nigeria is restructured. We are not going to support any Presidential candidate under this constitution. We must change this constitution first.” On why Afenifere was not taking part in the current constitutional amendment handled by the National Assembly Adebanjo said “They are beneficiaries of fraud. The 9th Assembly is part of the problem so how can they solve it? You can see how the National Assembly messed up the amendment of the Electoral Act. Are they the ones you expect to bring change?” Also the pan-Northern socio-political organization Arewa Consultative Forum said on Monday that there was nothing wrong asking for that presidency from their region. The National Publicity Secretary of the ACF Mr Emmanuel Yawe told one of our correspondents in a chat in Kaduna that the Nigeria’s constitution granted Nigerians the rights to speech freedom as well as freedom to vote. The ACF’s spokesman said “The Nigerian governors from North  and South have been acting as pressure groups since 1999 when democracy returned. “The constitution grants them the freedom of speech freedom of association and freedom to vote their preferred candidates.” Earlier Yawe spoke to another correspondent saying “When a candidate emerges on the platform of a party we will then interact with that candidate and find out from him what plans he has for the north. But we cannot say a political party must choose a candidate from North or South.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Agitators for the Yoruba Nation gathered at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota on Saturday amid the presence of armed policemen and soldiers. Jumoke 25 who displayed soft drinks at her boss’ shop located in a compound close to the rally ground when security men chased some agitators into the premises was hit by a stray bullet. She died on the spot. Speaking with our correspondent on Monday the family’s lawyer Olasupo Ojo said the family was waiting for the result of the coroner’s inquest before taking any legal step. Ojo said the family would hold the state police commissioner responsible for Jumoke’s death. He said “We want to expose the lies of the police; they lied that the lady died before the rally and they lied to the whole world that she was not killed by the police. We have applied for a coroner’s inquest to get the government to take over the corpse and an autopsy to be carried out to determine the actual cause of death. “We are waiting for the outcome of the exercise but of course we already know that it was the police bullet that killed her. After the outcome of the autopsy we are going to sue Lagos State and the Commissioner of Police himself because he was the one that headed that operation. “We take him personally responsible for everything that happened that day; it was a peaceful rally he made it violent and luckily he could not kill anybody among the protesters because they were peaceful and now descended on everybody around that place and succeeded in killing the lady. “We will also sue Lagos State because they didn’t issue any statement to prevent the police from causing mayhem at the rally. The whole world knew it was peaceful and saw the police unleash mayhem and violence on everybody so it was even more of a police rally than a rally for self-determination rights. “We will hold the police responsible and accountable for the life of that young lady that was lost and we will not stop. If the national court fails we will go international. “The police know the particular police station that bullet was issued to and which officer handled the gun that fired that bullet so we want to know the man who killed her.” Copyright PUNCH.

The two-day tournament holds July 9 and 10 at the ultra-modern Dynamite Wrestling Gym in Yenagoa the Bayelsa State capital. The event is aimed at getting the five Tokyo-bound Team Nigeria wrestlers in prime shape before their departure for the Games later this month. Chairman Caretaker Committee of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation Daniel Igali disclosed that the tournament was part of the federation’s plans for the delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. “The plan we have for the Olympics stipulates that a week before they travel (to Tokyo) we’ll have a tournament for them” the world and Olympic champion said. “So we are going to be inviting four training partners. They have two training partners in camp so we are going to bring in two more training partners from different states of the federation. “We are hoping to have everybody have four matches. And we are going to mimic the Olympics completely. At the Olympics you’ll have about four bouts. So we are going to look at four bouts here. If you win three bouts you’ll get into the finals and you’ll wrestle the next day.” In Tokyo former world number one Odunayo Adekuoroye (57kg) 10-time African champion Blessing Oborududu (68kg) Commonwealth Games gold medalist Aminat Adeniyi (62kg) and youngster Adijat Idris (50kg) will represent Team Nigeria in women wrestling while 2018 African champion Ekerekeme Agiomor (86kg) will fly the country’s flag in the freestyle event.

{"id":"427","headline":"Firm to promote wealth creation opportunities in Lagos","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/firm-to-promote-wealth-creation-opportunities-in-lagos","stories":"Pertinence Group an enterprise development company has expressed its commitment to promoting wealth-creating opportunities for Nigerians in Lagos. It said this in a statement on Monday titled ‘Pertinence Group to help Nigerians create wealth in Lagos’. The firm said it was willing to showcase wealth opportunities in Lagos State during its upcoming wealth summit. The Co-Founder Pertinence Group Mr Wisdom Ezekiel said the wealth of Lagos resided in every sector of the state economy but required knowledge to unravel it. He added that there were some identified and unidentified challenges faced by residents in Lagos that required solutions. Ezekiel said “If you look at the challenges of Lagos you would mention traffic bad roads and a couple of others; but mention real estate you would say that is much more problematic. “The thing about challenges is that once you see one realise that there is money in there. If you solve the problem you get paid for it. So the real money of Lagos is in solving problems. If you can solve the problem of the people of Lagos it means that you make the money that is in Lagos.” The Group Chief Executive Officer Pertinence Group Dr Stephen Oluwatobi said many still believed that money making was mystical and dedicated to family pedigree. He said “The wealth summit is an initiative of Pertinence Group and the idea is to help people capitalise on the opportunities available in Lagos. “Our mission is to empower people and that’s why we are an enterprise development and people empowerment company and to do that we need to educate people about wealth creation and money so that people stop thinking that making money is mystical but attainable by anyone.” Copyright PUNCH.

The victims Divine Nwonye whose company is based in Taraba State; and Sunday Odo a newly transferred FRSC official told The PUNCH on Sunday on their hospital beds that the incident happened on Thursday July 1 2021. While describing the attack on their families as ‘wicked and unprofessional’ they stated that till date they had not been told their offences or why their apartments were raided and the doors and windows destroyed. Nwonye had bruises on his back and a swollen shoulder while Odo had neck fracture and bruises on his back and face. Nwonye said “I was sleeping around 3am on Thursday when I heard bangs on the gate. I woke up and because I am living on the third floor of a three-storey building at the New Haven Extension Enugu I peeped through the window and saw two commuter Hiace buses outside the gate and saw people scaling the perimeter fence. “I was so terrified and there was no light. I was confused and I peeped through the window again; they had opened the gate and some were climbing with a ladder to the first floor and started breaking windows and doors. “They were moving from one apartment to another. I was confused and I woke my children my wife and my brother who works with the FRSC and we started praying.” He added “We thought they were armed robbers because they were not in uniform. We were praying until they got to my apartment broke the iron doors and came in. “They ransacked the apartment. While we were lying face down they started hitting me and my eight-year-old son with the iron pipes they were carrying.” He stated that when they got down they saw some people in mobile police uniform wielding AK-47 rifles adding that before they broke into his apartment he had called the New Haven Police Division but policemen did not come until they had been dragged into the attackers’ vehicle. “They did not tell us who they were until we found ourselves at the Enugu zonal office of the EFCC. When we disembarked from the bus they took my phone and started pressing it and after a while it was returned to me and they asked me to go. They seized my farm implement” he added. Odo said “The EFCC operatives said they beat us because we didn’t open the door.” When the spokesperson for the Enugu zonal office of the EFCC Mrs. Bethel Ude was contacted on the telephone she said she had no such information. “Sorry my dear I don’t have such information” she stated.

{"id":"429","headline":"Soyinka slams FG over handling of Igboho Kanu","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/soyinka-slams-fg-over-handling-of-igboho-kanu","stories":"Nobel Laureate Prof. Wole Soyinka has slammed the Federal Government over the invasion of the residence of Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho and the manner of the re-arrest of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu. Soyinka who spoke on Monday during an interview on BBC Pidgin said instead of declaring Igboho wanted the government should apologise to him for the “criminal” act of attacking his home. He said the activist’s mission of fighting for the oppressed in the South-West was not wrong in the absence of government intervention. “My advice to the government is that they should stop pursuing this person as a criminal because you have begun by acting in a criminal fashion against him. “If and when Igboho comes to trial I guarantee you the government will be very embarrassed. “I think they should tell Igboho ‘We made a mistake we should not have acted in this way you are no longer wanted go back to your home’. In fact escort him to his home and let him resume his normal life” he added. The playwright also faulted the Federal Government for not describing AK-47-wielding herdsmen as terrorists waging a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State. He said the leadership of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria ought to have been apprehended over their past roles and comments. “The government cannot wash itself clean on what seems to be a kind of comparative energy in pursuing the destabilised forces in the nation.” Soyinka also described the extradition of Kanu as a kidnap saying such acts stood condemned under international law. He said “It’s not for me to tell the President to prepare himself because it’s going to be a huge squawk when the truth about how Kanu was arrested comes out. People are alleging this or that. That is one phase whether Nigeria has acted outside international law. “The second issue however has to do with Kanu’s conduct outside the nation. There’s been a level of hate rhetoric which has been unfortunate from Kanu. Hate rhetoric is an issue that can only be judged by the laws of any nation. “Was it right to have been kidnapped? You can say ‘intercepted’ as much as you want but I think Kanu was kidnapped. That is wrong internationally and morally.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"433","headline":"Group kicks as Kano Assembly suspends anti-graft boss","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/group-kicks-as-kano-assembly-suspends-anti-graft-boss","stories":"The Kano State House of Assembly has suspended the Chairman Kano State Public Complaint and Anti-Corruption Commission Muhuyi Magaji Rimin-Gado for one month. The suspension of the anti-graft agency’s boss followed a petition received from the Office of the Accountant-General of the state on the refusal of Rimin-Gado to accept a chief accountant posted to the commission. The chief accountant deployed in the agency was rejected and issued with a rejection letter according to the state Accountant-General Alhaji Shehu Mu’azu. This necessitated the office of the accountant-general to send a petition to the state House of Assembly for its intervention on the matter. After heated deliberations on the floor of the House it was agreed that Rimin-Gado be suspended for a period of one month to give way for investigation into the matter. The Assembly set up a committee under the leadership of the Chairman House Committee on Public Complaints Umar Musa Gama to investigate the matter. Rimin-Gado ran into trouble when the state government realised that he was living a flamboyant lifestyle allegedly above his earnings. Other allegations against him include not turning in records of donations from the Open Government Policy programme as well as recovered funds not known to the government. Meanwhile an anti-fraud group said on Monday that Rimin-Gado’s suspension violated the law that set up the anti-corruption agency. The Human and Environmental Development Agenda in a statement signed by its Chairman Mr Olanrewaju Suraju said the suspension of Rimin-Gado reflected a conscious attempt to muzzle the commission and undermine its independence by the political leadership of the state. HEDA said the suspension was not only suspicious but against the law that sets up the commission. “The suspension of Magaji (Rimin-Gado) has raised a lot of credibility problems for the Kano State House of Assembly. From all indications the lawmakers wanted to impose a stooge on the chairman to interfere in the finances of the commission” HEDA said. The group quoted Section 8 of the law setting up the commission which states “In exercising its powers under this law the commission shall not be subjected to the direction and control of any authority.” Copyright PUNCH.

The Commissioner for Environment Mr Yakubu Usman disclosed this in an interview with The PUNCH in Jos on Monday.

The commissioner stated “For the past two weeks our men and the Task Force on Environment have been working on most of the major drainages in the city of Jos and its environs. “We have asked the various local government areas in the state to do the same and clear the drainages because the Nigeria hydrological services’ report captures about seven LGAs as prone to flooding and we have sent out the report to them. And those in high risk areas include Mangu Bokkos Wase Langtang North Jos North Jos South and Shendam. “The council areas need to work on their drainages to remove any forms of blockage because that is the major cause of flooding” Similarly the Imo State Government on Monday announced that it had activated processes to stop flooding in Owerri the state capital.

Another eyewitness said that the minister slumped as she stood up to deliver her address and inaugurate the programme saying “She (Katagum) just held her head and went down flat. Her aides and other officials quickly intervened and rushed her to the hospital.” When our correspondent visited the Trauma Centre of the ATBUTH he was stopped from going inside by security agents at the gate of the facility.

The association’s President Olumide Akpata in an email newsletter to lawyers in Nigeria on Sunday said the move was to help lawyers charge the right fee for their services. Akpata wrote “The committee is to broadly speaking design a workable and enforceable framework under which lawyers will (i) charge the right fees for their legal services using acceptable and realistic metrics; and (ii) ensure that those fees when earned trickle down in terms of reasonable living wages and emoluments to those who work with or for the lawyers. “This project is not only important to me but is also necessary for the economic well-being and advancement of our members.  It is for this reason that I am writing to you” it reads in part. He also called on lawyers to be involved in the process to enable the committee to develop a framework for lawyers in the country. He added “Since setting up the committee members have been meeting periodically to deliver on their mandate.  As part of that process and in order to get inputs from lawyers themselves the committee has (a) put together a questionnaire to be completed by lawyers; and (b) appointed a consultant Viisaus Technology Limited to carry out a random survey amongst lawyers via phone calls and other means. “The committee needs your input to develop a robust and largely acceptable framework. The NBA therefore encourages you to kindly participate in the process and cooperate with the consultants if contacted.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

With his genitals badly damaged a voice said “This man is called Matador Enyi-Oha na Osru. He is from Orsu Iheti Ikea in Imo State. “A diehard lover of the Fulani slave masters because of money. He was a PA to one state House of Assembly member and also a special assistant to one House of Representatives member but presently working for government. “He was very instrumental in leading the Nigeria terrorists’ army to be bombing Orsu. Afterwards government released money for him to share in Orsu to say that nobody was killed in the bombings knowing quite well that a lot of people lost their lives in the military air bombardments. “In his next generation he will not be a saboteur to his people. This is a warning to all those sabotaging the Biafran land.” But reacting to the viral video the state police command said that it had commenced investigation into the incident. The command’s spokesperson Michael Abattam said on Sunday that the command was on top of the situation. He said “The Imo State Police Command is aware of the iniquitous and obscene video that has gone viral on social media where a man was seen tied horizontally to a stick and undergoing inhuman act by some suspected hoodlums. “The command wishes to inform the good people of Imo State that we are already on top of the situation. Presently a high powered investigation team has since been inaugurated by the Commissioner of Police to commence technical investigation into the viral video with the sole aim of unravelling the truthfulness of the video and to trace the location if it actually occurred in the state. “The command is assuring the good people of the state that as soon as this is clarified the outcome will be made public for all and sundry to know the real facts surrounding the viral video. “Meanwhile the Commissioner of Police Abutu Yaro uses this medium to call on the good people of Imo State to remain calm and go about their lawful businesses. He also advises that anyone with useful information about the viral video to come forward with it or contact the command’s Radio Room through these numbers: 08034773600 and 08098880197.” Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"498","headline":"Emails used for fraud don’t belong to suspects – Witness","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/emails-used-for-fraud-dont-belong-to-suspects-witness","stories":"An investigating officer with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Mubarak Sade has told a Federal High Court in Uyo Akwa Ibom State that none of the email addresses used in defrauding Norwegians was linked to a suspect standing trial. The witness made this known in his testimony before the court on Friday while being cross-examined by the lead defence counsel Oladayo Ogungbe. Sade was led in evidence by the EFCC counsel Nwandu Ukoha to reveal findings of investigation conducted over a petition received from the Norwegian police authorities relating to cybercrimes and alleged fraud. The defendant Olatunji Ishola had previously pleaded not guilty after being arraigned by the commission on 50 counts bordering on cybercrime and fraud. During the cross-examination Ogungbe asked the investigator if the defendant’s name appeared on any of the petitions received from the Norwegian police. In his response Sade told the court that the defendant’s name did not appear in any of the petitions filed. However he said the flight ticket extracted from the computer hacked bore the name of the defendant. Ogungbe then asked if the commission in the course of investigation carried out forensic analysis of the various emails sent by the Norwegian authorities to ascertain the authenticity of the alleged fraud. The investigator stated that the commission relied on the petition for further investigation noting that EFCC personnel were not part of the Norwegian investigation team. Ogungbe urged the court to have it on record that the EFCC only acted on hearsay to arrest and arraign his client without concrete evidence linking him to the alleged fraud. When Ogungbe asked if the defendant’s phone number was linked to any of the identified emails the investigator told the court that it was only linked to the flight ticket.     Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"499","headline":"Kanu: FG must also tackle killer herdsmen others says expert","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/kanu-fg-must-also-tackle-killer-herdsmen-others-says-expert","stories":"A security expert Col. Hassan Stan-Labo (retd.) has admonished the Federal Government to deploy security agencies after killer herdsmen bandits and kidnappers with the zeal and vigour it went after Nnamdi Kanu the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra and the Yoruba nation activist Sunday Igboho. Speaking in an interview in Abuja on Sunday the retired military officer who pointed out that Kanu’s arrest and extradition were in order added that the government must protect his rights and grant him access to his lawyers and medical care. He said “The average Nigerian is today disenchanted with the situation in his country. Our youths are highly frustrated and vexed with the Nigerian nation its leadership and the older generation.   “It is also hoped that the zeal energy and effort put into the pursuit of  Kanu and Igboho would equally be brought to bear in our search for kidnappers bandits herders and defaulting members of Miyetti Allah group.” Stan-Labo added “So far the impression in the eyes of the public is that this high-level expertise is selectively deployed against certain segments of the Nigerian society. This does not speak well or serve as good testimony for a government determined to uphold its commitment to the social contract it has with the people.” The security consultant called on the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to dialogue with Kanu and Igboho and other separatist groups. He stated “The handling of Kanu’s case by the Federal Government could lead to an escalation and likely emergence of another version of Boko Haram on the Eastern flank or de-escalation. “I strongly suggest that the President holds a one-on-one chat with Kanu Igboho and other separatists. I don’t subscribe to the application of brute force as the only solution to this separatist issue.” Similarly a Nigerian Civil War veteran and former Captain of the Nigerian Army Ahmed Adoke has called on the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami to speed up the trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu. Adoke made this call on Sunday in a press statement. He also alleged that the IPOB movement has caused more deaths and hardship to the people it represented. The statement read “Let truth be told ever since its creation in 2014 the atrocities of the IPOB have caused more deaths and economic hardships to the people it claim to represent. “Now that the goose is finally at hand I am confident that the Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami SAN in his quest for rule of law would ensure that speedy justice is done in the trial of Kanu.” Adoke said those of them who fought the Nigeria civil war would never wish another for their children or generations to come.  Copyright PUNCH.

Recall the Assembly had on Tuesday June 29 approved the governor’s N4 billion requests for a credit facility from Zenith Bank. In his letter to the House Okowa explained that the loan was to enable his administration complete ongoing people orientated projects. However the opposition APC in a statement signed by its state caretaker Publicity Secretary Sylvester Imonin said “The N4bn loan was not only approved hastily but was done in a commando style without any due diligence or questioning by the House of Assembly of the sincerity and purpose of the loan. “Delta APC and most Deltans are worried because the said approved loan was not tied to any specific project (s) “The projects to be funded with the loan were not mentioned yet the ‘Honourable members’ without raising eyebrows and ensuring that they act in the best interest of Deltans quickly approved the same. What an amalgam of people! A rubber stamp legislature at best. “Information at the disposal of Delta APC is that the approved loan is to be used to fund the buying of utility vehicles and financial inducements to some politically unstable Deltans that the PDP led-government of the State wants in the PDP at all costs.” The APC further said “The future of Deltans and generations yet unborn cannot continue to be mortgaged because of the greed of a few in Government circles.” Copyright PUNCH.

Only the SA on Security Matters survived the purge. The sack was contained in a statement by the Acting Secretary to the State Government Alhaji Kabiru Balarabe. The statement read in part “This decision is in line with the recent decamping to the APC and to allow for an in-depth search of more but competent hands in the administration of the State irrespective of political affiliations. “Accordingly all the affected Special Advisers should hand over affairs of their respective offices and Government properties under them to their Directors General and\/or Accounting officers. “The Governor appreciated their contributions in running the government while in office. The decision takes immediate effect.” It was gathered that as part of conditions given to the governor prior to his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party to join the APC the governor agreed to share appointive positions with other party leaders.

{"id":"502","headline":"17 southern govs discuss Buhari’s land recovery order for herders","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/17-southern-govs-discuss-buharis-land-recovery-order-for-herders","stories":"The President Major General Muhammadu Buhari’s (retd.) order on the recovery of grazing routes for herders will top the agenda of today’s meeting of 17 southern governors The PUNCH has learnt. It was gathered that the meeting which would hold eight weeks after the governors met in Asaba the Delta State capital would further assess decisions taken in Asaba on the open grazing ban restructuring fiscal federalism and the call for state police. The governors would be hosted by Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the meeting which would start by 10am today (Monday). Aside from the host governor others expected at the meeting are Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (Ondo) Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia) Emmanuel Udom (Akwa Ibom) Diri Duoye (Bayelsa) Willie Obiano (Anambra) Ben Ayade (Cross Rivers) Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta) David Umahi (Ebonyi) Godwin Obaseki (Edo) Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti) Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu) Hope Uzodimma (Imo) Dapo Abiodun (Ogun) Adegboyega Oyetola (Osun) Oluwaseyi Makinde (Oyo) and Nyesom Wike (Rivers). Recall that the governors in a communiqué issued at the end of the meeting in Asaba banned open grazing as part of moves to address killings and kidnapping by herdsmen. But a few days after the meeting  the Presidency faulted the ban on open grazing. The Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu had in a statement said “It is equally true that their (governors’) announcement is of questionable legality given the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) regardless of the state of their birth or residence.” Also the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami SAN slammed the southern governors for banning open grazing. According to the AGF open grazing ban is the same thing as Northern governors banning spare parts trading in their own region considering the fact that southerners comprise a majority of spare parts traders in the North. The President during a recorded television interview in June also backed Malami’s position adding that he had directed that grazing routes be recovered. When asked if he agreed with the AGF’s position Buhari had responded “You want me to contradict my attorney-general?” Explaining further he said “What I did was to ask him to go and dig the gazette of the  First Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving up country north to south or east to west they had to go through there. “If you allow your cattle to stray into any farm you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The khadi or the judge will say pay this amount and if you can’t the cattle is sold. And if there is any benefit you are given and people were behaving themselves and in the grazing areas they built dams put windmills in some places there were even veterinary departments so that the herders are limited. Their route is known their grazing area is known. “But I am telling you this rushing to the centre (sic) so I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on these cattle routes and grazing areas will be dispossessed in law and try to bring some order back into the cattle grazing.” Speaking to The PUNCH on Sunday a top source close to one of the governors said the southern governors were disturbed about Buhari’s order on grazing routes adding that they suspected a hidden agenda. The source also stated  “The governors will meet physically tomorrow (Monday) in Alausa Lagos. All the 17 governors in Southern Nigeria will be present at the meeting. They will speak on some of the issues they raised in Asaba.” Asked of the issues that would top agenda at the meeting another source close to one the governors in the South-West South-South and South-East said the governors would deliberate on the pronouncement of the President. The source who wished to remain anonymous because he was not authorised to speak on the matter said “They would discuss the issue of security and open grazing ban. They are going to focus on topical political issues. The governors will be deliberating on the recent order by the President that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami recover some lands for herdsmen to graze in the country. They believe it is an agenda to Fulanise the country.” Also one of the information managers to one of the governors in the region said “The meeting will address killings in spite of the ban on  open grazing. Aside from open grazing restructuring autonomy for judiciary will also be discussed. “The attorney general of the federation is not an attorney general of the Federal Government. He is an attorney general of the federation behaving like the attorney general of the Federal Government. So any case involving anybody with the Federal Government is a lost case because you have an attorney general of the federation behaving like the attorney general of the Federal Government. “When the southern governors banned open grazing the AGF declared the act as illegal. They didn’t react when he said that. That is how mature people behave. But tomorrow (Monday) the governors will take a position on the Federal Government’s reaction” the source said. Asked whether the governors would also discuss the raid by the Department of State Services on the Ibadan house of Yoruba activist Sunday Adeyemo also known as Sunday Igboho the source stated “Igboho is not nationalistic. The agenda of the Southern governors is broader than Igboho but you can’t rule it out that when they are talking of regional security they would talk about him. “They spoke about him when Igboho spoke against herders-farmers crisis but they stopped talking about him the moment some people entered into his head and he started Yoruba nation rally. It is not a right time at all.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Igboho who is a promoter of the Yoruba Nation has gone underground following the invasion on Thursday during which the secret police said it killed two persons and 13. Speaking with our correspondent on Sunday the Communication Secretary of the Ilana Omo Oodua Mr Maxwell Adeleye said the group which is being led by a renowned historian Prof Banji Akintoye would not abandoned Igboho and others. The group’s spokesman also said the group would make sure that those arrested during the Yoruba Nation rally held in Lagos on Saturday were released. He said Igboho’s aides did not commit any crime just like the protesters also did not violate any law by their actions. Adeleye said “The counsel for Igboho  Chief Yomi Aliu (SAN) has written the DSS Inspector General of Police. “Igboho is a law abiding person and he has not violated any law. None of his family member was attacked by herdsmen but his love for his people made him to rise up to speak for Yoruba people who are being oppressed in their land. He never killed anyone but he is being hunted while tknown criminals are being pampered. “Igboho has debunked the claims of the DSS. He said the weapons displayed by the DSS did not belong to him. He said two guns were taken away from his house and the two guns belong to the police orderlies of his guests.  He said other things were not from his house. “Ilana Omo Oodua is with Igboho and we are going to stand by him. Those arrested at his house will be released very soon. We are working on that. After all they did not find them with guns or anything incriminating.  Their only offence is that they were at Igboho’s house and I don’t know when that became an offence. “What is the off made of Lady K she is a blogger who was reporting the action live. She lives in Igboho house and I don’t know if that is a crime.” “Nigerian government will be surprised by the number of senior Yoruba lawyers that will represent them. We won’t tell you their names and their number now because we won’t discuss all our strategies publicly.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The youth were handed over to the Department of State Services according to activist and former Presidential candidate Omoyele Sowore. He said “Security men at the Dunamis Church have arrested activists wearing #BuhariMustGo T-shirts to their church service; church security later handed them over to DSS officials who are currently torturing them. I thought Pastor Dr Paul Enenche was also preaching about justice! The five activists were driven away in a DSS Hilux van and two power bikes. Shame in the house of God.” When our correspondent visited the Dunamis headquarters to confirm the incident all attempts to speak with the church administrative body proved abortive as protocol officers claimed that the members were having meetings hence would not be able to talk about the issue at the moment. However a top church official who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not permitted to speak on the issue confirmed the incident. He said “Those people sneaked into the church; I used the word sneaked because the church was not aware of their intention no department in the church knew anything. “They even came out for the altar call and before you know it we saw that they had Buhari-must-go T-shirts and they were recording people making it seem as if the church planned the protest. “We had to hand them over to security operatives because we believe in three things. It is either they were sent in by agencies to make sure that the church is at loggerheads with the government or either make it seem like the church sponsored the protest. “Third is even if they have a genuine protest the church is not the right place to go. If there is a problem in the country the duty of the church is to pray that God help our leaders. We have handed them over to the authorities for investigations.” When our correspondent sought more answers the Deputy Chief Security Officer of the Church identified only as Mr John called on policemen nearby to harass and arrest our correspondent. When contacted the Police Public Relations Officer in the FCT Mariam Yusuf refused to comment on the issue. Also the spokesman for the Department of State Services Peter Afunaya did not take his calls. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Barring any last-minute changes the bill is expected to be passed by both chambers on Thursday. “Some proposals canvassed by citizens were adopted in the bill e.g. electronic voting financial independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission and new timelines for submission of list of candidates. However there are discrepancies between the approved version of the bill and the alleged final copy where some key provisions have been manipulated. “In the alleged final copy some key priority amendments were rejected by the leadership of the National Assembly e.g. electronic transmission of results has been prohibited (S.50(2)) and the limits on campaign expenses have been increased (S.88). We are also concerned that the National Assembly has rejected the proposal empowering INEC to review the declaration of scores and return of candidates made by a Returning Officer and determine that the declaration was made under duress or contrary to the provisions of the law (S.65). “Following the events of the 2019 general elections we are convinced that INEC needs to have this power in order to prevent politicians from going through the backdoor to win election and steal electoral mandate at gunpoint! It is instructive to note that following the submission of the Electoral Amendment Committee’s report the National Assembly leadership undertook an additional review of the report to insert and reject some amendments unilaterally without going through the established process for such insertion” the statement partly read.

In the petition titled ‘An urgent appeal for correction of lopsided appointments in the Niger Delta Development Commission leadership’ signed by the group’s coordinator Reginald Uwakwe in Abuja on Sunday. The communities expressed disappointment that key appointments especially into the office of Managing Director has been skewed in favour of only four out of the nine oil producing states. They alleged that so far the position of MD of the NDDC has rotated among: Rivers Akwa-Ibom Bayelsa and Delta states to the exclusion of others. This they claim was in violation of Part IV of the Act establishing the NDDC. While urging the president to address the anomaly the petition read in part “We the Urashi Peoples’ Congress an umbrella body of all the Oil Producing Local Government Areas in Imo State want to bring to your attention the urgent need for the correction of lopsided appointments in the leadership of the NDDC. “The bias appointment which has persisted since the Commission came into existence over the years has assumed a critical and sensitive dimension of great concern that if left uncorrected is capable of threatening the operations and truncating the activities of the Commission.” While listing alleged beneficiaries of the lopsided appointments the petition further read “it is pertinent to inform you that a compromise was reached that the position would be rotated within the nine oil producing states namely: Abia Akwa Ibom Bayelsa Cross River Delta Edo Imo Ondo and Rivers.” Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"512","headline":"PIB: North Ogun’s quests for oil get boost exploration receives 30%","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/pib-north-oguns-quests-for-oil-get-boost-exploration-receives-30","stories":"The quests for oil in the North and other parts of the country including Ogun and Anambra states have received a huge boost in the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill which will regulate the oil sector if signed by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)  findings have shown. Currently crude oil is obtained from eight states in the Niger Delta region which include: Abia Akwa Ibom Bayelsa Delta Edo Imo Ondo and Rivers States. Based on Section 9 of the PIB at least 30 per cent of the profit generated by the proposed Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited will go to the exploration of oil in ‘frontier basins’. Although the proposed law doesn’t identify the frontier basins a statement by the President in 2019 identified the frontier basins as Chad Basin Gongola Basin Anambra Basin Sokoto Basin Dahomey Basin Bida Basin and Benue Trough. Besides northern states  Ogun State whose Tongeji Island is in Dahomey Basin will benefit from the new policy. Anambra State with Anambra Basin will also benefit. The 19 northern state governments had in 2016 intensified their search for oil and gas in the region with the appointment of a British firm to carry out the exploration activities which was sequel to Buhari’s directive to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to increase the tempo of the crude oil find in the North-East. The Chairman Northern Nigeria Development Company owned by the 19 northern state governments Mallam Bashir Dalhatu had said the British company had commenced its prospects for oil and gas in the Lake Chad and Benue basins using the services of the British company. Dalhatu had said “We have engaged a British company that is already working in the Lake Chad region and from Niger and Chad side in the same area with us and we have been meeting with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in order to put efforts together. “The Federal Government has also re-emphasised to us during those meetings its total support for exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in the North-East of the country.” With the passage of the PIB however the oil exploration move of the 19 northern governors has received a huge boost. Section 9(4) of the PIB reads “The frontier exploration fund shall be 10 per cent of rents on petroleum prospecting licences and 10 per cent on petroleum mining leases; and 30 per cent of NNPC Limited’s profit oil and profit gas as in product sharing profit sharing and risk service contracts. The fund shall be applied to all basins and undertaken simultaneously.” Section 9(5) adds “NNPC Limited shall transfer the 30 per cent of profit oil and profit gas to the frontier exploration fund escrow account dedicated for the development of frontier acreages only.” The PIB also makes provision for the establishment of a Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission which will be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of upstream petroleum operations and also promote the exploration of frontier basins in Nigeria Meanwhile the lawmaker representing Degema\/Bonny Federal Constituency in Rivers State at the House of Representatives Farah Dagogo has condemned the PIB Dagogo a member of the Peoples Democratic Party in an interview with journalists on Sunday said the PIB “has been received with mixed feelings by some prominent personalities in the Niger Delta.” While noting that the bill when it becomes law would revolutionise the petroleum sector to be competitive for economic development the lawmaker said he had reviewed the objectives of the bill and discovered some irregularities. Dagogo said “A critical analysis and review shows that the bill passed leaves more questions than answers for resolving the gamut of challenges associated with the petroleum industry which first governing law was enacted in 1969. “So the answer to your questions with all intents and purposes is that the core content of the passed bill could be regarded as a sham and a bogus display of an infamous fluke orchestrated by the majority against the minority whose land and people are afflicted amidst affluence. “It demonstrates the unending reasons for the vociferous calls for restructuring because of disorder and injustice that currently permeate the Nigerian state. Indeed it was a ploy to further rob Peter and pay Paul.” When asked about the grey areas in the PIB the lawmaker said “A critique of the passed bill shows some enervating factors that are highly disturbing: First the Senate’s reduction of compensations payment for host communities from 5 per cent to 3 per cent against the cries and appeals of southern senators; second the redefinition of host community to mean any “community that oil pipeline passes through.” “By implication host communities will now imply (that) all states that do not even produce oil but have oil pipelines passing through them. Before now host communities were communities that produce oil or have petroleum facilities\/installations in their land.” Dagogo added “The passed bill also has a jargon known as ‘Frontier Exploration’ for which the bill has provided 30 per cent of NNPC profits to be servicing these ‘Frontier Explorations’ yearly. This I dare say is over-ambitious and very unsustainable. My constituents interpret this to mean that a certain percentage of revenue say hypothetically 30 per cent from mines or gold from the North is set aside for gold and mine exploration from the ocean in the South. “How do you justify this bare faced farce? You get the point? It is just another avenue of exacerbating corruption and appears to be a desideratum to fraud. This does not guarantee the fiscal direction and original intent of the bill which seeks to provide legal governance regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry and the development of host communities.” The lawmaker noted that while development of host communities was visibly and conspicuously displayed in the long title of the PIB which consequently gave direction to the problems the bill intended to resolve “the National Assembly dominated by the All Progressives Congress has negated that trust; and the upper chamber (Senate) wherein the bill originated from surreptitiously decided and wittingly they changed the order and concocted a discordant view which could be regarded as an anathema to natural justice.” When asked about efforts by the minority caucuses to protect their interests in the PIB Dagodo said “The bill as passed is a perpetration of the existing oligarchic spirit fanned by the colonial masters. The challenges that led to Sir Willick’s Commission of Inquiry on the minorities are still very fresh and the ghost still chases modern Nigeria. It is still very inherent in the Nigerian system and PIB has exemplified it.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Despite the suspension many Nigerians have been using Virtual Private Networks to access the micro-blogging site forcing the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami to threaten them with prosecution. Some groups including the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project dragged the government before the ECOWAS court which restrained it from arresting Nigerians using the site. Speaking with The PUNCH a Twitter user Goodness Adeosun berated the Federal Government for allowing the ban to last this long. She said the ban had affected her business. Adeosun stated “These moments are the lowest point for me in business; the ban has really affected my sales turnover. “I had been selling on Twitter for the past three years and I didn’t focus on other platforms because Twitter was offering what I wanted in terms of visibility and potential customers and no one ever thought of the ban ever happening. “I remain optimistic that the ban will be lifted soon.” A journalist Blessing Oladunjoye said she joined in the suit because the ban violated the freedom of expression of Nigerians and had affected journalists sourcing information. She said “I joined some journalist colleagues and NGOs to file a suit at the ECOWAS Court against the Federal Government over the indefinite suspension of Twitter because the government’s action is a violation of the right to freedom of expression and has greatly interfered with our works as media professionals; sourcing information getting sources for reports promoting stories networking with fellow citizens and colleagues both in Nigeria and in the Diaspora and accessing media related opportunities. “SERAP and some Nigerians also filed a similar suit at the ECOWAS Court and the court has already given an interim ruling which restrained the Nigerian government from prosecuting people for using Twitter. This is a good start and the ruling makes it clear that the court believes that interfering with people’s use of and access to Twitter is a violation of their human rights but the ban still needs to be reversed by the Federal Government.” The Deputy Director of SERAP Kolawole Oluwadare faulted the ban adding that the group and others had taken the government to the ECOWAS Court which ruled that no Nigerian should be arrested. He added that the main case challenging the legality of the government’s action was slated for hearing on Tuesday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

According to a statement on Sunday a delegation from the state government led by the Abayomi and the Director-General of the Lagos State Safety Commission Mr Lanre Mojola visited SCOAN at the weekend to inspect facilities at the church for COVID-19 safety and prevention compliance in preparation for the funeral of Joshua. Abayomi in the statement said the inspection was in line with the third wave mitigation strategy of the state government to prevent the importation and spread of new deadly strains of COVID-19 into Lagos and Nigeria. The commissioner noted that the late prophet was a prominent person with a large congregation and followers globally thus the funeral rites would expectedly attract people from within and outside Nigeria. He explained that the state government considered the funeral activities at SCOAN an important event enough to ensure strict compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols to prevent the importation transmission or spread of the new deadly strains of COVID-19 infection to the state or the country. The statement read in part “The inspection and meeting with officials of SCOAN is at the behest of the Lagos State governor who directed that SCOAN be given all the support required to host the funeral programme for its late founder under strict COVID-19 prevention protocols to limit any possibilities of introduction of foreign COVID-19 variants among the congregation and by extension to the community. “In these very precarious times that we are in with a global pandemic that is evolving dynamically what we now know is that there are different strains of the virus circulating around the world and Lagos State has a very strong third wave prevention strategy. “The likely cause of a third wave is going to be an importation from visitors who are infected with the virus so we are particularly careful about working with the Synagogue to make sure that we have a collaboration that will reduce the opportunity to zero of us either importing a virus or even allowing someone who is positive to interact with the community.” Copyright PUNCH.

The Registrar Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria Dr Tajudeen Sanusi disclosed this in an interview with our correspondent on Sunday. The MDCN is saddled with the responsibility of regulating the practice of medicine dentistry and alternative medicine in the most efficient manner that safeguards the best healthcare delivery for Nigerians. Sanusi told The PUNCH that the 70 cases to be decided early August were those recommended for trial among the petitions already investigated by the council. There has been increasing outcry about negligence on the part of some medical practitioners leading to the death of their patients. Sanusi said “We shall communicate the date but they will be facing the tribunal early August. “Those who are guilty will be sanctioned.  “We have about 70 cases. We can’t take all cases but definitely we shall try our best.” Sanusi also faulted Nigerians who opt to report malpractices involving medical practitioners on social media rather than making formal complaints to the council. He said complaints meant for the council must be accompanied by court affidavits. “When people have complaints they will not complain but go on social media to say all sorts of negative things. “A complaint must be formally lodged and it must come with a court affidavit.” Sanusi had earlier told The PUNCH that the MDCN was investigating over 120 cases of allegations of professional negligence against medical practitioners operating in Nigeria. He had said the council was doing all it could to make sure that practitioners who had petitions written against them were thoroughly investigated and those found guilty were disciplined appropriately.

Oshogwe was quoted in a statement as saying this at the 2021 edition of the Lagos Real Estate Fest held in Lagos. She noted that while it was not a task left entirely to the government the government had key roles to play in reducing the steadily rising housing deficit in the country. She said “The government needs to get more involved to make housing more affordable. When we talk about public-private partnerships or strategic joint venture projects with the private sector there is a lot they can do. “As they say the government owns all the land; at least give us the land and it will greatly reduce the high cost of development. Foreign exchange rates are not very favourable now so there should be areas where we can have some subsidies to make affordability a reality.” The Afriland Properties boss who spoke on attracting and retaining investment in Nigeria’s real estate market highlighted that creating enabling investor-friendly policies would provide a tremendous boost to the sector. Oshogwe added “There needs to be some form of standardisation in place as this will create confidence among our clients and investors. With standardisation in the industry you trust who you are going to buy a house from. “Equally if I am to give my property to an agent or property manager for rental purposes I should be able to trust that the agent would carry out the right level of due diligence on the prospective tenants.

This was disclosed at the academy’s annual lecture held on Thursday in the University of Lagos. The lecture titled ‘Locating engineering and technology in government policy framework for growth and development’ was delivered by Prof. A.F. Ogunye a past president of the NAE. Ogunye said Nigeria’s growth had been severely hampered by the absence of sound engineering input in public policy formulation and implementation and tasked the government on appointing engineers to facilitate development for the country. “As a deliberate act of governance engineering and science input and reviews must explicitly form part of policy articulation processes and procedures. “It is imperative that seasoned engineers be appointed to positions of authority in government; especially in ministries departments and agencies whose responsibility remits have high engineering content. They must however be held to account by the relevant engineering professional bodies.” In his speech the President of NAE Alex Ogedegbe said the academy’s goal was to ensure the progress of engineering through learning advocacy and collaboration with relevant stakeholders in government academia and the industry. The occasion also marked the induction of new fellows and the conferment of lifetime achievement awards. The inductees were Ademola Adisa Prof. Emmanuel Aluyor Felix Atume Dr Daniel Ayo Prof. Isaac Itodo Prof. Daniel Obikwelu Bayo Olarewaju-Alo Mustafa Shehu Kayode Sote and Prof. Moses Tade.

He said many lives had been lost while many parishes were currently closed. He therefore charged all stakeholders to match their words with actions to end insecurity in Nigeria. Hammawa stated these while delivering a homily at the graduation of catechists at the Catholic Catechetical Training Institute in Jimlari near Jalingo the state capital. The bishop said “The world has never been without challenges but the challenges facing Nigeria now are enormous. The growing insecurity in Nigeria is worrisome and needs to be urgently addressed. “In Taraba State the crisis is quite disturbing and the Catholic Church is always the worst hit anytime it erupts. At present many parishes in our diocese are closed. Many lives have been lost during these attacks and valuable properties destroyed. “This situation calls for action. We need to tell ourselves the truth to be able to defeat the forces of evil that are working against the peace and security of Nigeria.” Hammawa charged the graduating catechists to be objective and fearless in discharging their duty for the good of the Church and the society. In his remarks the director of the institute Rev Fr Simon Akuraga said leadership failure was a major problem facing Nigeria and said the Church had the responsibility to give people hope. Sunday PUNCH reports that 25 catechists who graduated from the institute were commissioned to commence work in various communities across the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"569","headline":"FG insists Kanu’s rearrest repatriation followed legal process","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/fg-insists-kanus-rearrest-repatriation-followed-legal-process","stories":"The Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has said the rearrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu was in accordance with the legal process. The Special Assistant to the Minister on Media and Public Relations Jibrilu Gwandu in a telephone interview with one of our correspondents on Friday stated that the IPOB leader was represented by a lawyer throughout the judicial process that led to the grant of his earlier bail. Kanu who is facing an 11-count charge of treason treasonable felony terrorism and illegal possession of firearms among others jumped bail in 2017 and left the country only to re-emerge in Israel and then in the United Kingdom. The former London estate agent was rearrested on Tuesday. He was initially arrested in late 2015 after calling for a separate state for Biafra in South-East Nigeria. He was re-arraigned before a Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday and ordered to be remanded in the custody of the DSS while the case was adjourned till July 26 and July 27. Gwandu told Sunday PUNCH “Bench warrant was lawfully and judiciously procured through judicial process by a competent court of law whose bail conditions he breached with impunity. “He (Nnamdi Kanu) has been represented by a counsel all through the judicial process and was never denied a right of choice of counsel or recourse to one even when he symbolises a proscribed association (IPOB) in law and in fact his association has been legally proscribed. “So there was no illegality in the entire process.” Gwandu also told one of our correspondents that although the Office of the AGF had a meeting with the British High Commissioner on Thursday the IPOB leader’s rearrest was not discussed. “The legality or otherwise of Nnamdi Kanu’s arrest was not discussed in the meeting. I sent you a press release on the issues that were discussed. The meeting was scheduled long before the arrest” he said. The PUNCH earlier reported that the United Kingdom said it would seek clarification from the Federal Government on the circumstances and legality of Kanu’s rearrest. The Head of Communications British High Commission Mr Dean Hurlock had stated this while responding to enquiries from one of our correspondents on Wednesday. The Office of the AGF in a statement on Thursday also stated that the AGF Abubakar Malami (SAN) had a meeting with British High Commissioner Catriona Laing adding that the issues discussed were the Electoral Act amendment Petroleum Industry Bill and Twitter ban. The Federal Government explained that security and intelligence agencies were on the trail of Kanu for over two years before he was rearrested saying the head of the outlawed IPOB movement was detained again on Sunday – without giving details on the location of his arrest. Kanu’s detention in 2015 had sparked mass protests and clashes with security services. IPOB which agitates for a separate Igbo state has denied being behind the violence accusing the government of a smear campaign. Election offices have also been attacked by suspected members of the group. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"572","headline":"Human trafficking rising in Edo Delta Kano –US report","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/human-trafficking-rising-in-edo-delta-kano-us-report","stories":"Majority of Nigerian trafficking victims in Europe and other parts of the world are from Edo Delta and Kano states the United States has said in its ‘Trafficking In Persons Report June 2021’. The report released by the US Department of State chronicled the menace of human trafficking globally in about 200 countries across different continents. The report significantly noted that the Nigeria government was yet to fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but it was making efforts towards developing its anti-trafficking capacity. It therefore stated that Nigeria was upgraded to Tier 2 in 2021 from Tier 2 Watchlist in 2020. The report partly read “Historically the majority of Nigerian trafficking victims in Europe have come from Edo State via Libya; however observers noted an increasing number originating in other states to include Delta and Kano. “Additionally officials noted that Abia Delta Ebonyi Edo Imo and Kogi states are common origins for trafficking of victims to West Africa and Europe. “Cases of labour trafficking involving domestic workers to the Middle East and Gulf States as well as men coerced into sexual exploitation and drug running to Europe increased during the reporting period according to an international organisation. “In 2019 the media and an international organisation reported that networks consisting of illicit actors profiting from human trafficking and smuggling recruited women and girls from IDP camps in North-East Nigeria for ostensibly legitimate jobs in Europe but exploited them for commercial sex in the northern Nigerien city of Agadez North Africa the Persian Gulf and Europe. “Primarily in Cross River and other southern states as well as from IDP populations in the north illicit actors – including some church leaders – operate ‘baby factories’ which the government and NGOs describe as a widespread criminal industry in the country; experts state the phenomenon is driven by poverty and a lack of opportunity for young girls as well as the demands of the illegal adoption market and cultural pressure for large families in Nigeria.

Rollas made the call at the International Summit on Peace and Unity for Nigeria on Saturday in Abuja. The summit with the theme ‘Promoting Peace within our Borders’ was convened  by the Chairman of UN Rescue Services Steve Midalah; National Coordinator of the National Youth Development Project Bonaventure Chimee; and the ALGON Peace Project and others. Rollas noted that there was a need to change the narrative about Nigeria from the worst to the better. He said “Film producers should produce films that would promote peace and unity in the country not only  rituals love weddings and what have you because without peace we cannot enjoy love and weddings. “I want to urge the government to use films as a better medium to promote peace and unity in the country. “The influence that Nollywood has around the world can be used by the government and its agencies to promote peace unity and peaceful co-existence. “It is also necessary to state that many filmmakers in the country are looking for commercial success thus they may not venture into propagating peace and unity. The government can fill the gap.” The AGN president added that the guild remained a change agent adding that what they did in films was what viewers imbibed in their day to day living and as such  peace and unity should be preached in films. Rollas also stated that the advent of social media had further shrank the world as a global village hence the need for  government to use the opportunity to promote the oneness of Nigeria. He added “Youths react to what they see on social media. I urge them not to listen to selfish politicians who are after their own personal interests. They tell political lies and post divisive contents on the social media to cause problems. “We need to douse the tension by telling people the real story via films. We should stop celebrating fantasies and use every aspect of Nigeria to promote Nigeria. “If there is a negative propaganda about a particular tribe the government needs to produce a film to tell the true story to enhance peace and unity. It is called ‘propaganda management’. “If a film is produced about peace unity and coexistence among different religious adherents and tribes it will go a long way to change the negative narrative.” Copyright PUNCH.

Mohammed who spoke at the unveiling\/launch of a parallel secretariat of the APC in Ilorin the state capital on Saturday said the recently concluded registration exercise conducted for members in the state was not genuine in that it did not capture every member of the party. Sunday PUNCH reports that the state government and a faction of the APC led by the minister had held a parallel rally to mark the two-year celebration of the party in power in the state. While Governor AbdulRahman Abdulrazaq’s faction of the party has its party secretariat located at the Tanke area the minister’s faction unveiled its secretariat at GRA Ilorin. Mohammed said “The recently concluded membership registration exercise conducted in the state is a charade as most members of the party were not given the opportunity to register as the registration documents were not made available to them. “When we observed this myself and two former governorship aspirants Prof Oba AbdulRaheem and Alhaji Tajudeen Audu went to the National Chairman of the party Alhaji Mai Mala Buni and he assured us that a fresh registration would be done for party members in Kwara. “We didn’t know him before he has no campaign office. The battle line is now drawn; without you members there would be no APC in the state. I want to assure you all that no party congress will hold in Kwara State until the fresh registration\/revalidation exercise is conducted for all APC members in Kwara State.” AbdulRazaq on June 26 alleged that a cabal within the party who received hundreds of millions of naira as donations for the Kwara struggle did not deliver a kobo to him. But Mohammed denied receiving donations from any minister or governor of the party as campaign funds for the 2019 general elections in the state saying “I never diverted APC 2019 general elections campaign funds for my personal use as alleged by Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq. “By the grace of God I single handedly with the support of friends and family raised all the monies for the Oke-Ero\/Isin\/Ekiti\/Irepodun Federal Constituency by-election of November 2019 that brought Tunji Olawuyi to the House of Representatives. “And I challenge anybody here to say he gave the party one penny apart from what I gave them. I challenge anybody here to say he gave logistics support to the party. I did that by the grace of God.” The minister said he distributed 500 motorcycles and 20 vehicles adding that many of the beneficiaries were in attendance to buttress his claim. He added “I want them to explain to Nigerians what happened to the N70m that Mr Olawuyi kept that the governor refused to give us during the by-election. But for the grace of God and some friends there would have been no election in November 2018 because when we raised money we gave them but two days before the election we could not reach them on their phones anymore. “I had to go to friends to raise another N150m to prosecute that election. I remember very well that there are 42 wards in that constituency. We thank God today that was the beginning of our success. When elections proper came we did not see our governorship candidate. We could not wait.” Mohammed stated “without any fear of contradictions” that the money raised from friends colleagues and associates were used to finance the four elections adding that the party in the state scored 100 per cent. “I remember a governor calling me when we won the first election to ask if it was true we won the by-election. And I told him ‘yes sir.’ He said ‘I want to apologise to you when you came to me for money they told me not to give you money. They told me you are a Lagos politician and nobody could defeat Saraki.’ “But then we did not know that God brings more wonder. That is how we won all the elections. But today they have got there and forgotten the people that put them there. If we did not give money to the party how did he think the party won?” he asked. All efforts to get the reaction of the governor to the alleged non-accountability for the campaign funds proved abortive as the governor’s Chief Press Secretary Rafiu Ajakaye neither picked calls to his phone nor responded to questions sent to him on WhatsApp. The Special Adviser to the governor on Political Communication Mr Bashiru Adigun however said “It is a matter concerning the party and the party will issue a statement soon.” Factional Chairman of the party Bashir Bolarinwa urged members of the party to register and revalidate their membership when the exercise begins in the state and also reminded them to renew their voter registration cards. Other party leaders who spoke at the gathering included a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Ilorin and former governorship aspirant Prof Shuaib AbdulRaheem and a member of the House of Representatives AbdulGaniyu Cook-Olododo. Others were a former governorship aspirant Tajudeen Makama; Akogun Iyiola Oyedepo; and a member of the state House of Assembly Prince Saheed Popoola who backed the minister’s claims on the campaign funds.

Mai icce who spoke to Sunday PUNCH on Saturday said the food was cooked by his eldest daughter in the afternoon and eaten by the 10 family members. “Myself Rafiatu Bashar Babangida Rabi and Suwaiba were not at home” he said. He noted that the entire family would have died if everyone was at home and partook in the meal. Mai icce stated “The food (tuwon dawa) was cooked by my elder daughter in the afternoon and was eaten by the 10 children who were at home while six of us were away. I received a phone call from one of my neighbours that one of my children was having frequent diarrhoea and vomiting. I quickly returned home and took him to the hospital. When I was in the hospital I also received another call that the remaining children were affected by diarrhoea and vomiting. I returned home and took them to the hospital where three of them died in the night while the remaining seven also died the following day. He further said that the whole episode was like a drama to him stressing that he had never experienced the kind of agony he went through. He stated “I was completely dumbfounded as a result of the calamity but I leave everything to God as a Muslim. It was a drama to me. I know that was how they were destined to die. We that were not at home that day weren’t destined to die then. Otherwise we would have been at home and also ate the food and died too.’’     Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"580","headline":"Raid: Igboho’s lawyer writes FG demands N500m compensation","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/raid-igbohos-lawyer-writes-fg-demands-n500m-compensation","stories":"A lawyer to Yoruba rights activist Sunday Adeyemo popularly called Sunday Igboho has demanded N500m from the Federal Government for the losses incurred by his client after officers of the Department of State Services raided his residence. The DSS operatives on Thursday stormed the Ibadan Oyo State residence of the activist who had been advocating Yoruba Nation. The services later issued a statement confirming the raid disclosing that two Igboho’s aides were killed and ammunition allegedly retrieved from his residence. In the letter titled “Illegal gang grossly unconstitutional invasion of Sunday Igboho Residence’’ signed by the lawyer Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN) of Chief Yomi Alliyu & CO on Saturday he demanded N500m as reparation for damage done by the DSS’ officers to his client’s exotic cars which included Mercedes Benz G-Class and 2019 Lexus car. The solicitor also stated that during the house invasion the DSS carted away €1000 N2m expensive jewellery worth millions travel documents amulets Igboho’s iPhone 12 and phones of about 15 others living in the house including those killed by the officers and other yet-to-be-identified belongings. He added “We hereby demand that the Federal Government orders an investigation into the actions of the various security operatives led by DSS that raided Chief Sunday Adeyemo’s house with a view to sanctioning them and release all the innocent people arrested and compensate the families of those murdered. Our client should also be paid N500m as reparation for damage to his exotic cars that include Mercedes Benz G-Class and 2019 Lexus Car. We also demand a public apology.’’ The lawyer further said that every Nigerian was aware that in Igboho’s open crusade for the creation of Oodua Republic he always preached peace and warned his followers never to resort to violence. He said “He always said that It is God and alale” that will fight for Yoruba Nation. We can boldly say that as people who followed his campaign but not necessarily supporting dismemberment of Nigeria that no casualty has ever occurred wherever such rallies were carried out.  This must have been done in more than 20 Yoruba towns and cities as at date. “No demand to enter was made but rather they shot their way into the house allegedly killing seven people though DSS spokesman admitted killing two people which involved an old imam that used to lead Muslim occupants in prayers and observing Tahjud at the time of the barbaric raid. A lady among the invaders was allegedly shouting “If you get him gun him down.” He also alleged that the operatives were disappointed that they couldn’t allegedly find a single gun or ammunition in his client’s house hence arrested two police escorts of Igboho’s guests and added their “guns to those harvested from their armoury to make members of the public to believe that our client keeps militia or as stated by them he is about waging war on Nigeria. Will this be with his mere amulets? People who know our client of over 20 years will testify that Igboho Oosa does not carry gun on his person!’’ In his reaction on Saturday the DSS said it stood by its statement on the items recovered from Igboho’s residence after the raid. The Spokesperson for the services Dr Peter Afunaya who spoke with Sunday PUNCH said “The statement by the services suffices. The statement also said those arrested would be charged accordingly. There would be court action.” On whether the DSS would react to the statement on the items taken away from Igboho’s residence Afunaya said “the services statement suffices. Investigations and forensic analysis are ongoing. There would be court action.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"582","headline":"Electoral Act: Trouble looms in Senate as panel rejects electronic transfer","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/electoral-act-trouble-looms-in-senate-as-panel-rejects-electronic-transfer","stories":"There may be a stormy session on the floor of the Senate during plenary on Tuesday as senators are set to receive and debate the provisions of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Independent National Electoral Commission Senator Kabiru Gaya is expected to lay his panel’s report at plenary. However an investigation by our correspondent revealed that some senators from the southern part of Nigeria are spoiling for a showdown with some of their northern colleagues over the INEC panel’s report. One of the senators from the South who is also a principal officer told our correspondent on condition of anonymity on Saturday  that some powerful members of the INEC panel had inserted “a danger clause” into the report. He specifically said that the report of the committee barred the INEC from transmitting results of elections by electronic means. He said “If they want war we are ready for them because the only thing that could make our elections to be credible is through the electronic transfer of results. “There was electronic transfer of results during the Edo State governorship election and that was why the poll was very credible. “Those who are opposed to the electronic transfer of results are preparing to rig the 2023 general elections.” But another principal officer from the northern part of the country who also spoke on condition of anonymity justified the reason for barring INEC from transmitting results by electronic means. The Senator said “There will be gross injustice if we allow the INEC to transmit results electronically because most parts of the north are not enjoying efficient network service from the telecommunications companies. “Take for example the North-East geopolitical zone where Boko Haram insurgents had destroyed the masts of the service providers how do you want the issue of electronic transfer to be possible?” A careful observation of the amended Electoral Act reveals that Section 50 (2) states that INEC could make use of electronic voting but should not transfer the results by electronic means. The section reads “Voting at an election under this bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the commission which may include electronic voting provided that the Commission shall not transmit results of elections by electronic means.” When contacted the spokesperson for the Senate Dr. Ajibola Basiru said he would not make any comment on the development. Basiru said “Since the provision has not been considered at the Senate I have no comment.” Sunday  PUNCH  had early last month reported that the plan to save the nation’s electoral process from malpractices by making card reader and electronic transfer of results compulsory during polls was generating controversy in the Senate.  Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"584","headline":"Igbo group lawyer seek justice for slain salesgirl","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/igbo-group-lawyer-seek-justice-for-slain-salesgirl","stories":"The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders and a human rights lawyer Adeola Oyinlade have called for the arrest and prosecution of security operatives who allegedly killed a salesgirl identified only as Jumoke during the Yoruba Nation rally held on Saturday in Ojota Lagos. COSEYL in a statement by its President General Goodluck Ibem condemned the killing adding that the regime of the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) had become worse than that of the late military head of state Gen. Sani Abacha. The statement read in part “The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders the apex socio-political youth group in the South East geopolitical zone condemns in strongest terms the ruthless shootings against unarmed protesters by the Nigerian police and other security agents in the Yoruba Nation rally in Ojota Lagos State that led to the untimely death of a 14-year-old yoghurt seller Jumoke. Peaceful protest which is a fundamental human right of all citizens is not allowed in a supposed democratic government. Nigeria has gone back to the dark days worse than Abacha’s military junta “It is no longer news that so many families are going to bed on a daily basis hungry as a result of the harsh economic policies that made things so difficult for Nigerians. Most families can hardly boast of just one meal a day. People are dying because of excessive hunger and starvation in the country. “The only democracy dividends in Nigeria today are hunger starvation killings by murderous Fulani herdsmen\/terrorists massacre by Boko Haram terrorists and ISWAP and food shortage caused by the activities of the terrorists who make it very difficult for farmers to go to farm.” Also the human rights lawyer Oyinlade described Jumoke’s killing as sad unwarranted and avoidable noting that it raised serious concerns over the strategy policy and tactics of Nigeria’s policing system. He said at this critical period in the country the police should adhere to human rights and international standards to gain the trust of the people while carrying out their duties lawfully. Oyinlade stated “One should know that when live ammunition is used on protesters there would be a casualty. I do not see a justification or proportionality of firing live bullets in this case which has now resulted in the death of an innocent girl who did not commit any crime. “The plethora of laws in Nigeria does not empower the Nigerian police to abuse firearms or kill any person at will. The constitution is emphatically clear that no person shall be deprived of his or her life except in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence of which the person has been found guilty. “With a number of avoidable deaths recorded while quelling protests over the years in Nigeria the police should immediately embrace human rights based approach to policing and ensure that the Nigerian Police’s actions are in accordance with the fundamental principles for the development of a fair and just society. “The innocent girl killed today (Saturday) deserves justice. Her parents and family members have been put in an unexpected state of mourning. I call on the leadership of the Nigeria Police Force Lagos State Command to immediately commence investigation on this matter fish out and prosecute the killer.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"585","headline":"2023: It’s Igbo’s turn to produce president Ohanaeze Ezeife insist","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/2023-its-igbos-turn-to-produce-president-ohanaeze-ezeife-insist","stories":"The apex Igbo socio-political organisation Ohanaeze Ndigbo has advised the Federal Government to support the emergence of an Igbo president in 2023 to quell the agitations in the South-East region “to the barest minimum.” Elder statesman and former Governor of Anambra State Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife; Chairman Ohanaeze Ndigbo Elders Council Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu; and Publicity Secretary Ohanaeze Ndigbo Alex Ogbonnaya spoke in separate interviews with Sunday PUNCH. Ezeife said “The almighty God who created the heavens and the earth has agreed that the South-East region will produce the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is just a matter of justice and fairness. “Beyond that Nigeria has made progress and undeniably so because of the immense contribution of the people of Igbo descent. The Igbo are everywhere in Nigeria developing things in the country committed to economic growth. “As we all know we don’t run a segmented society. Everybody has human rights. In order for Nigeria to progress there is no point keeping the Igbo down. This is why the presidency for the 2023 general elections should go to the South-East.” He decried the “injustice” the Igbo face in their search for a better life like other Nigerians. “I was the Chairman Power Sharing Committee during the National Conference of 2014. We decided then that zoning and rotation are right and important for a thriving democracy. Even if it is not in the constitution it became a practice. Buhari is supposed to complete eight years in office so it should go to the South. “The South-West held power for about 11 years. The South-South region has held power for six years so if we are not rejecting Igbo people as citizens of Nigeria we must allo w an Igbo man to become president” he said. Similarly Iwuanyanwu said from the political arrangement of the country the president should come to the South after eight years of the current tenure led by the North. He said “When it does come to the South then the sub-regions of South-South South-West and South-East will come together to decide which section should produce the president. “But I feel out of justice and equity with the kind of unity that we have now between these constituent regions they would be given to the South-East that is if the South-East has a good candidate because the president of Nigeria cannot just be anybody. The candidate has to be acceptable to everybody.” Also Ogbonnaya in his remarks decried the level of “injustice” against the region arguing that the lopsidedness of the presidency was evident to all. “People who sat together and talked about the idea of living together as one country thought of the union as a federation managing people of diverse groups with diverse interests and cultures. If you say for the security architecture the South-East should have at least one. “Each ministry should have at least one Igbo heading it. Then the agitations will reduce to the barest minimum. There must be representativeness in everything as far as we claim we are operating a federal system. The concept of federal character must be upheld at all times “Above all it is the turn of the South East to become the president of Nigeria.  If there is a body language by the Federal Government indicating that all these agitations and threats of secession will stop” he said.   Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"586","headline":"Movies can influence society positively negatively –Rotimi Adelola","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/movies-can-influence-society-positively-negatively-rotimi-adelol","stories":"A filmmaker Rotimi Adelola has said that films had the power to influence society in positive and negative ways. Adelola who is the producer of the award-winning movie The New Patriots told Sunday Scoop “Movies can influence society in both positive and negative ways. They can inspire individuals and expand knowledge and perspective. Movies can also induce bad habits and behaviours. For example the American movie Green Book focused on racism and was able to show that people of different races could bond when they spent time listening talking and living with one another. Another American film All the President’s Men told the story of how two reporters from the Washington Post investigated the Watergate Scandal. The movie was so inspiring that many people enrolled to become journalists after watching the movie. “In the same vein many youths will change the way they relate with career politicians after watching The New Patriots.  Also many politicians will change their attitudes values and electioneering behaviour after watching the movie. “The June 12 1993 presidential election has been described as a watershed in the history of elections in Nigeria because there were no cases of manipulation of youths by career politicians to commit electoral crimes as we have it today.” Adelola who holds a PhD in Psychology from the University of Ibadan also stated that in a country like Nigeria with endemic poverty a breakdown in communication between the government and the people was inevitable. He said “In any society where endemic poverty is prevalent there would be an underlying breakdown of communication between the government and the masses. This was the case in the Republic of Aruguna where The New Patriots was set.  As a result of the breakdown in communication the youths which represented 70 per cent of the population became restive and resorted to self-help. This is similar to the current situation in Nigeria.” The filmmaker also disagreed with those who said that Nigerian films were devoid of messages. He added “Not all Nigerian movies are barren of meaningful messages. There are some world-class Nigerian movies such as Dazzling Mirage by Tunde Kelani Oloture by Mo Abudu and Citation by Kunle Afolayan. However some Nigerian movies have induced nefarious habits and behaviours by focusing unduly on societal ills such as money rituals prostituting-for-wealth and mindless violence.” Recalling what stirred his interest in filmmaking Adelola said “My interest in filmmaking had been deep seated in my subconscious since I was a teenager. It also got expression when l was expected to be on retirement having worked at very senior management positions across both the private and public sectors between 1982 and 2017. Be that as it may my preoccupation now is to deploy audio-visual story telling as a catalyst for social change.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"587","headline":"Owning a law chamber at young age tough challenging — Mohammed Abdullahi Minister of State for Science and Technology","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/owning-a-law-chamber-at-young-age-tough-challenging-mohammed-abdullahi-minister-of-state-for-science-and-technology","stories":"What can you recall of your childhood in Nasarawa State? It was fun. I remember village life with nostalgic feelings. My father was a caring and doting father. We were always eager to wait for him whenever he travelled or came back from work. He always bought us biscuits sweets and other goodies. In those days Cabin biscuit was the in-thing and we ate it with relish. However my mother was a disciplinarian who was always rebuking us for one wrong or the other. She is alive and still has a tough mien about her. What was your fondest childhood memory? I recall climbing mango trees and plucking mangoes to the disapproval of my mum. Then we liked playing hide-and-seek under the moonlight. Those days were really fun in the village. What influenced your decision to study Law? In those early days my father had a television that we plugged using a car battery. Most of the villagers used to gather around our house to watch it. Usually our father switched on the TV at night from Fridays to Sundays. There was a popular TV programme then called ‘Crown Court.’ I think it was a British courtroom drama. I loved their regal dresses composure air of authority and spoken English. I am not sure I really understood what they were saying then but their comportment mesmerised me. So I said to myself if I grow up I want to be a lawyer. What particularly piqued your interest in common\/Sharia law? I think those childhood memories the awe of speaking grammar in court and to a large extent to assuage the fears of my mother was responsible for my interest. My mother has the belief that lawyers would go to hell because they tell lies. So I told her I would study both Sharia and common law — it’s a combined honours degree. It took my father’s intervention to convince my mother to allow me read Law. Again I wanted to have the benefit of a comparative advantage to study common law side by side with Shariah law. It is an interesting admixture of law. I particularly enjoyed Islamic Legal Jurisprudence and of course common Law. We were exposed to legal jurisprudence and the basics of English or received English laws. But I enjoyed constitutional law and law of torts. Most lawyers are influenced by Lord Denning (an English lawyer and judge) as a great jurist but for me Lord Thankerton (a Scottish politician and judge) remains an inspiration. He set the ‘Control Test’ in the relationship between an employer and employee in a contract of employment and made very incisive rulings on Law of Torts. Maybe because of his background as a Scot or perhaps because of the underlying frosty relationship between the Scots and Brits that could have influenced his thoughts. With all benefits of hindsight I think I made the right choice. Why did you decide to join politics? I did not make a conscious decision to join politics; it was more of a coincidence. I reluctantly went with a friend to a political party rally and from there I got a bit interested. Gradually I got enmeshed in it. I tried a couple of contests and lost. The intrigues manipulations and horse-trading are mind-boggling. Since then I go off and on alternating between legal practice and politics. As of now I have 30 years post-call experience. You’re the founding partner of Tafida Chambers (Massers Hammart & Co. Solicitors\/Advocates). How were you able to own a law chamber at a young age? It was very rough tough and challenging. Most clients don’t want inexperienced lawyers. They would rather go for the big names. But the experience I had during my National Youth Service Corps days in Enugu with Messrs Ukpabi Ukpabi & Co and a two-year stint with Olanipekun & Co prepared me for the challenges. But in most cases I was a dormant partner because I was hugely distracted by politics. Often times we go for months without clients or cases. When we do get clients they are mostly non-paying— mostly relatives having one case or the other or matrimonial issues. They end up begging one and telling one how good one’s parents were and the need for one to emulate them and be generous just to evade paying one’s fees. What are the fondest memories of your legal career? It was during my NYSC days. My principal sent me from Enugu to represent him at the Makurdi High Court before the Chief Judge. I left and slept in Makurdi. On that morning I was the first to get to the court. I literally met the cleaners doing their work. Meanwhile that was my first appearance as a lawyer after being called to the Bar. My chest was thumping and I was a bit scared when I saw the lawyer on the opposing side. I remember he introduced himself as ‘Ekumankama Esq’. The judge came and the court was called to order. As we sat down Ekumankama as a senior lawyer called our case and announced himself. I also stood up and announced myself as the lawyer for the defendant\/applicant. The judge then asked calmly “Yes Mr Abdullahi what’s the position”? I stood up and stammered “We have a motion sir for extension of time to file our statement of defence.” I then sat down. The judge asked Ekumankama “Any objection”?  Ekumankama stood up with a magisterial and mercurial confidence of an experienced lawyer and said “Mi’Lord we are not opposing their application ‘per se’ but we shall ‘infra’ be asking for cost.” The judge then looked at me and said “Yes Mr Abdullahi what do you have to say”? I was actually confused and didn’t know what to say. Mercifully the Chief Judge gave his ruling instantly “Application is hereby granted no order as to cost. Matter adjourned to….” I was relieved and couldn’t wait to leave the courtroom. As I stood up and made towards the door the CJ called me and I answered. I was praying fervently that I did not make any mistake. I was scared stiff at that moment. The CJ then said “Your wig and gown look sparkling new.” I then said “Yes Mi’Lord I was called to the Bar last week. This is the second time I’m wearing it.” The CJ then said “Oh I see congratulations.” The courtroom was thrown into laughter. I smiled bowed and left. That experience has always been fun to me. What was your most notable accomplishment as the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice Nasarawa State? We introduced so many reforms that had to do with criminal justice. We opened a ProBono services desk domesticated the Pension Reform Act and did the compilation of laws of the state since the days of Benue\/Plateau Plateau and Nasarawa state. We also tried to model the MOJ after Lagos. Incidentally during my first stint as Attorney General (2003-2005) the Vice President Prof Yemi Osinbajo was the Attorney General in Lagos. He initiated and invited all states’ Attorneys General for a meeting to compare notes and learn from one another. That was when we tried to adopt the multi-door court house as a fast track process combining conciliation and mediation in adjudication. It was a very cost-effective process. We tried to introduce it but could not complete it during my short tenure. We introduced so many executive bills that were passed into law— Local Government Law Nasarawa State Chieftaincy Law and several laws establishing state bodies and agencies. What was your most notable accomplishment as the Secretary to the State Government of Nasarawa State? That would be coordinating the ministries departments and agencies effectively organising the civil service to key into our drive for the development of the state and liaising with security agencies to map out a strategic security agenda to keep the state safe. We were facing serious security threats then and it behoved my office to provide that seamless platform. We organised several capacity building workshops and training for staff of the civil service and built a befitting office complex with a modern e-filing system of records. Did you expect your political appointment as the Minister of State Science and Technology? To be honest when President Muhammadu Buhari nominated me I was super elated for the opportunity to serve our country. It is a great privilege and I don’t take it for granted. I truly and deeply appreciate the honour from the President. What are some of your achievements? It is about two years as of today. Firstly I’m not alone in the ministry. There is a Minister— Dr Ogbonnaya Onu who was here earlier so whatever we have achieved is a collective effort. Would you say that Nigeria has made significant strides in the science and technology sector? Certainly we have made progress. However these are not physical things you see like roads and bridges. It is basically a research and development-driven ministry. We have made progress in the field of biotech where we made great efforts in seedlings that have more yield and can stand the challenge of ants and temperate weather. We are also making efforts to resuscitate the textile industry to create jobs by providing good yielding cotton seeds that will be easy to cultivate. In lather technology we have tried to revive our tanneries by providing super and chemically clean hides and skin. This is to minimize the importation of leather products and save resources. We have also provided the country with an opportunity to do away with our mono-product economy via methanol technology for clean and reliable energy. Through the Energy Commission of Nigeria we have worked on cleaner and more sustainable green energy to support our quests for stable power supply in the country. Also through our Sheda Science and Technology Park we are providing a one-stop hub for tech start-ups and budding entrepreneurs. We have also through the National Board for Technology Incubation raised several entrepreneurs leveraging on our facilities across the states. The National Biotech Development Agency is now partnering with Cuba to develop COVID-19 and other vaccines locally. We are now working to provide grid codes tech for address referencing as part of the nation’s geographic information infrastructure that is indigenous. Taking into consideration our peculiarities people tend to assume that science and technology is all about ICT broadband penetration big data analytics social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram but science and technology incorporates all gamut of technology including innovation artificial intelligence robotics space tech and biotech. Some people have said that Nigeria is lagging behind in the area of qualitative research. What’s your response to that? That’s true in some senses. We are actually good in research. What we lack is venture capitalists that can invest in these research findings and commercialise them for the purposes of industry and production. If we have such we will support our industries. It can create commercial activities and production which will generate jobs. However Nigerians have a penchant for foreign goods and services. That’s why the president signed Executive Order 5 to support local contents in engineering and related activities. How can we champion more discoveries in science and technology that would be beneficial to the country and the world? It is about research and development and innovation. Of course this has to come with the complimentary funding of such sector. Most countries advanced by funding science and technology but in Nigeria we have so many challenges which make it difficult to focus on just one sector. But recently the federal government decided as a policy to dedicate 0.5 per cent of our GDP to fund Science Technology and Innovation. This is revolutionary and hopefully will change the landscape of research and development for good. With your experience in government do you intend to run for any political position soon? When we get to that bridge we shall cross it.  What influenced your choice of a political party? Basically its manifesto the personalities and leaders in the party and its grassroots appeal. All over the world it is believed that ‘politics is a dirty game.’ What’s your take on that? It is about perception which unfortunately is mostly subjective. Every profession has its lows and highs. It is the humanity in us that defines who we are in any profession. Doctors teachers engineers clergy traders drivers all have ethical issues in their trade. Generally speaking politics is not a dirty game. How does one define someone like the late Sir Tafawa Balewa— Nigeria’s first Prime Minister? A man of impeccable character a patriot and nationalist who stood for Nigeria and died without even a house? I draw a lot of inspirations from such people in politics. How do you think our security problems can be solved as a nation? Everyone should be involved. Information and intelligence gathering are very important. Communities should not protect bad eggs simply because they are ‘our own.’ Our security agencies and forces must be supported. They are risking their lives to make us safe. Do you think that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led regime is doing enough to secure lives and properties of citizens? I think the government is doing its best to solve these challenges. There are issues I cannot disclose to avoid miscreants and bad elements taking a cue to outsmart the security agencies. From the briefings we get all I can say is that the government is doing its utmost best to protect us from all these challenges. Many Nigerians have said they do not feel safe living in the country anymore. Do you feel safe as a citizen of this nation? Yes I truly feel safe. There is no country without challenges. In the United States of America for instance it is about mass shootings in schools malls or houses. Yet the people don’t condemn the American police. Rather they rally round to give information to support investigations. But here the situation is different. People even celebrate when our forces are harmed. It is always advisable to be vigilant when one moves around watch who one interacts with and always be at alert. How do you spend time with your family? I wish there’s time for them. One is always busy these days. But any free time I have we go out a bit. But mostly their mum does all the work regrettably. However when I’m home we bond together. Would you say you’re a doting father to your children? I’m not sure but I try to make out time to play and chat with them. Like I said thanks to their mum she is filling the void.  What attracted you to your wife and how did you propose to her? I actually met her through an acquaintance. When we met she was a bit shy and tried to avoid me. She was looking radiant in a flowing gown with a unique carriage and calmness. I think that was the attraction. She later came to be so nice and accommodating. She is a software engineer and is so attached to computers and robotics. That helped me a lot in engaging the children.  Are you a football enthusiast? I think so. I like to watch football and lawn tennis. We have arguments with my wife when I’m watching matches. I get her annoyed once I’m watching sports channels. She would rather watch tech programmes. How do you spend your vacation in other parts of the world? I have not taken a vacation since I came on board as a Minister. Hitherto my favourite place was Mauritius. I like African tourism and sometime ago we were in Obudu Cattle Ranch (Cross River State) with the family. It was a lovely location. We also visit Kajuru Castle in Kaduna State— it is a mountain resort with an amazing view of the hills.   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"590","headline":"Doctors canvass innovative ways to solve Africa’s health challenges","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/doctors-canvass-innovative-ways-to-solve-africas-health-challenges","stories":"Two medical entrepreneurs Dr Yetunde Ayo-Oyalowo and Dr Funmi Adewara have called for innovative strategies to combat the problem of universal access to health care in Africa. Both doctors who are female inventors of accessible healthcare services also emphasised the need for solutions that were affordable easy-to-reach sustainable and efficient to solve the challenges in the healthcare sector. Dr Funmi Adewara who is the founder of Mobihealth International stated that Nigeria and Africa needed access to healthcare services adding that community-based solutions and technology could be leveraged to get to the least reached areas. Adewara said “As we move forward on the path of development Nigeria and Africa’s ability to create sustainable and efficient access to health care will depend largely on its capacity to invent deploy and scale up solutions that are sensitive and appropriate for individuals and local communities.” She commended the activities of other healthcare organisations providing innovative solutions to accessible healthcare services adding that through the use of technology Mobihealth had been able to provide accessible healthcare services to the end-users. The medical expert said “There are many other organisations doing their part in improving access to care including Mobihealth International deploying technology through Artificial intelligence-powered digital health tools to harness local and global medical human capital and resources to enable healthcare access to the last mile. “Mobihealth’s innovate initiatives has been commended by the United Nations as an inclusive and sustainable healthcare solution and recently won the World Bank SDGs Award 2020 amongst 2400 contestants globally a first time win for Nigeria.” Similarly Ayo-Oyalowo who is the founder of Market Doctors a company that provides affordable basic medical services to Nigeria’s underserved population said an innovative way was needed to solve the problem of universal access to health care in Africa. According to her if a person has to choose between having a meal and access to healthcare there is a problem. She said “The journey time to the facility the time they will spend seeing the doctor having tests going to the pharmacy; they don’t want to lose their income for that day. So what were are trying to do is to put all of these together reduce the overhead bundle healthcare into their shopping bags as they come to the market. “The way our services works is been able to convert any space into a clinic by either using a mobile truck or even a health worker with a backpack. We have reached over 180000 people. Market Doctors is going to be the game-changer in health care in Africa.” Ayo-Oyalowo added that Market Doctors was born out of the burden to provide accessible and proper health care services to ordinary Nigerians who do not have access to health insurance and rely on concoctions when they are sick. “I felt ordinary people do not have access to health care. I once worked in a health insurance company and I discovered that even with the reduced price only a little percentage of people could afford health insurance and health insurance is a sort of gateway to good health care. So I thought what happens to the man on the street how will they be able to access health care? So I asked around and I found out that people already found a way for themselves in going to the chemist and using the local concoction. So that was what formed the idea of what I can do to create access to the common Nigerian. That was how I began the journey” she added. The medical entrepreneur also said through the donation of some people on their birthday they have been able to provide more healthcare services for those in need of it. She added “We are also specialists in outreaches we help organisations conduct outreaches and we have a programme called ‘birthday blessings’ where we conduct special medical outreaches on the birthdays of those who donate to us.”   Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"594","headline":"Villagers flee as herdsmen threaten attack on Ogun community","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/villagers-flee-as-herdsmen-threaten-attack-on-ogun-community","stories":"Residents of Olokemeji village in Odeda Local Government Area of Ogun State have fled their homes for fear of possible attack by killer herdsmen. Our correspondent gathered that suspected killer herdsmen allegedly killed one of the residents of the village during an argument with the herdsmen. It was gathered that the villagers held a herdsman after his cattle destroyed their farm but the herder called his colleagues who allegedly invaded the village and killed a resident. The killing of the resident reportedly provoked the villagers who poisoned their farms an action that reportedly led to the death of some cows. This development reportedly angered the herdsmen who allegedly threatened to return to the village and attack the people. Our correspondent gathered that this threat had made the villagers flee their homes and deserted the community for safety. Schools have also been reportedly closed in the community. Confirming the situation the Transition Committee Chairman Odeda Local Government Area Bola Lawal said the incident happened five days ago. He however said the leaders of Fulani herdsmen in the state had met and asked the herdsmen not to attack the village. Lawal said other stakeholders including the security agents had held a series of meetings to forestall any attack. Also he said the governor had been informed of the situation and swung into action to nip the crisis in the bud. When contacted the Organising Secretary of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria South-West Zone AbdulMumin Ibrahim also confirmed the incident. Ibrahim said his people were attacked by the villagers while returning from Oyo State after they had left their homes in the village during the dry season. He said “The incident happened last week. I was informed that our members were returning to the village. They had left with their wives and children for Oyo State during the dry season. “When they got to the boundary between Oyo and Ogun states they were attacked and their cows were killed.” Ogun State police spokesperson Abimbola Oyeyemi said the situation had been brought under control.  He said “The  people are just being apprehensive. In fact the police are there every day and there have been meetings between the residents and the Fulani with police. “The villagers killed some cows and because of that they are apprehensive because of a possible attack.  “Apart from patrolling the village every day the police are also combing all the bushes in the village because hoodlums could be hibernating there.”  “The police have assured them of security. The Fulani herders whose cows were killed have held meetings with the local government chairman and they have reached a compromise” Oyeyemi added.  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The mood in the ancient and historic kingdom of King Jaja of Opobo on Saturday was euphoric as an ecstatic crowd thronged the road cheering Wike for completing the road connecting the island to the mainland of the state. The governor in his address to Opobo Nkoro Ogoni and Andoni indigenes at Opobo New Layout described the completion of the road and its inauguration as a dream come true for the people of the area and his administration. Wike according to a statement by his media aide Kelvin Ebiri titled ‘Gov Wike Waziri inaugurate Opobo\/Nkoro Road’ said he felt happy to have fulfilled his 2014 campaign promise to the Opobo people. He expressed appreciation to the previous administration of Dr Peter Odili for conceiving the Unity Road project. According to him without the foresight of Odili it would have been difficult for the current administration to complete the Opobo axis of the Ogoni-Opobo-Andoni Unity Road. The governor directed his Special Adviser on Special Projects to liaise with the monarch and leaders of Opobo on where they desired to be sand-filled and reclaimed for them by the state government. Wike also urged the Surveyor General of the state to commence the process of land mapping and survey of the already sand-filled land in the area to enable Opobo people to begin the allocation of spaces among themselves. On the Queenstown erosion menace he reminded the Opobo of the N3.1bn contract that was awarded when one of their sons was the Commissioner for Works adding that the company awarded the contract had disappeared after it had been paid a N2bn mobilisation fee. Wike told them that it was baffling that their native could frustrate such a developmental project attracted to the area which would have solved the erosion menace and ended the threat of Queenstown being washed away. “Sometime ago you wrote to me about the erosion in Queenstown. I told the Amayanabo the other day that the job was awarded when your son was the Commissioner for Works. “It was awarded to the tune of N3.1bn. The company collected N2bn and it ran away from the site. Amayanabo of Opobo go and ask your son who is that company that collected the money and refused to do the Queenstown shore protection” the governor stated. A former Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources Adamu Waziri who inaugurated the road expressed gratitude to Wike for solving the critical needs of the Opobo people. Waziri noted how excited the people were to have a motorable road to connect the island to the rest of the state. According to him Wike has brought humanity to governance. The minister stated that it was pertinent for Nigeria to remain united for the Opobo road to continue to be in the country. The Amayanabo of Opobo King Dandeson Douglas Jaja who said the people of his kingdom were eternally grateful to Wike for the humanity he brought to governance appealed to the governor to initiate another land reclamation project in Opobo.

{"id":"596","headline":"Why FG released impounded Swiss vessel after three years –Malami","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/why-fg-released-impounded-swiss-vessel-after-three-years-malami","stories":"The Federal Government on Saturday returned a Swiss vessel MT San Padre Pio which was arrested on the Nigerian waterways in 2018 to the Swiss government. The PUNCH earlier reported that the Federal Government agreed to release the Swiss-flagged San Padre Pio oil tanker that was seized in January 2018. Switzerland’s foreign ministry had made this known in a press statement on its website on May 20 titled ‘Switzerland and Nigeria sign an agreement for the release of the vessel San Padre Pio.’ According to the statement this followed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Ministry of Justice of Nigeria. On Saturday the Commander of the Nigerian Navy Ship NNS Pathfinder Commodore Abdullahi Ahmed a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Samuel Ojo and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami handed over the vessel to the Swiss government on behalf of the Nigerian government. Malami who spoke at the event said the return of the vessel would strengthen the ties between Nigeria and Switzerland. According to him the ship was captured on the Nigerian waterways when it was found without the relevant permits. He said “This process started in January 2018 when MT San Padre Pio was arrested. “While the Ministry of Justice was deliberating how to release the vessel unconditionally due to the diplomatic relationship between Nigeria and Switzerland the Swiss government went to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Germany on the matter of which the Tribunal ordered Switzerland to enter a bail bond of $14m (N5.8bn) in favour of Nigeria for the crew members to be released in line with Nigerian laws.” During this period Malami said the case was also going on at the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt Rivers State. “During this process Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and that of Switzerland met and agreed that the case should be resolved diplomatically due to the bilateral relationship between both countries. “Negotiations went ahead and on May 20 2021 an MoU was signed between the Federal Government and the Swiss government to release MT San Padre Pio unconditionally and allow it to depart Nigeria without hindrance and that the case at the International Tribunal should be withdrawn and the one in the Nigerian court should be closed. “All these have been achieved and that is why we are here to officially release the vessel to the Swiss government” Malami added. The Deputy Director of International and Comparative Law Federal Ministry of Justice Francis Ojo represented the AGF at the event. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"598","headline":"Reps hail PIB passage criticise process","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/reps-hail-pib-passage-criticise-process","stories":"The lawmaker representing Ohaji\/Egbema\/Oguta\/Oru-West Federal Constituency in Imo State at the House of Representatives Kingsley Chima has said the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill is the greatest achievement of the 9th National Assembly. Chima who is a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on PIB said the bill when it eventually becomes law would provide an organised governance policy in the petroleum sector. However the lawmaker representing Esan North-East\/Esan South-East Federal Constituency in Edo State Sergius Ogun said the PIB was imperfect. Addressing journalists in Abuja on Friday Chima noted that the PIB would create effective production proper management transparency and good governance in the sector. He said “The greatest achievement of the 9th House of the National Assembly is the passage of the PIB. If you recall you would agree with me that this bill has been in the cooler for over a decade and what it means is that there may have been issues of disagreements and grey areas; areas that are not actually agreeable by all the stakeholders. “It got to a point where too many people actually invested so much either regional political religious or even economic interests in trying to adduce their reason for not actually passing the bill. But yesterday (Thursday) the bill was given the greatest ovation anybody could think of in the National Assembly. “An overwhelming 99.9 per cent of the members on the floor – if not 100 per cent – agreed with the content of the bill as actually recommended by the PIB committee. That is to say the 9th Assembly under the leadership of Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila has actually given flesh and life to the corporate governance of our oil sector.” According to the lawmaker PIB would make the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation accountable to Nigerians as well as make more money available to host communities. Chima said “Section 53 made mention of having an NNPC that would be accountable to the people of Nigeria. That will guarantee the immediate registration upon assenting to this bill by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria having what we will call NNPC Ltd. “It will now be vested with the responsibility of making sure that the profit accruable from explorations in this country will be moved to the Federation Account as quickly as possible. “Section 240 is talking about the host communities and these host communities today are singing with joy because we have given impetus and powers and provided an enabling environment for you to participate in your own resources.” He explained that five per cent of operational cost by oil companies would be exclusively reserved for the host communities and would no longer be sent by proxy. However Ogun in an interview with journalists on Friday criticised the process leading to passage of the PIB while lauding the bill passage as a “good thing.” According to him no bill is perfect. The lawmaker congratulated Nigerians saying the country had lost out on a lot of investments that had gone to other countries. He also expressed hope that the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd) would assent to the bill and investors who were on the fence would invest in the country. He however lamented that there were not enough copies of the PIB adding that he made his grievance known to the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee and Majority Whip Mohammed Monguno. Ogun said “As much as I have gone through the bill again and again because I was part of the process that brought it to where it is today I still needed to have a copy. If whatever we have gone through is different from what was presented I cannot just go ahead and agree to everything; I just wanted to have a copy and flip through. “That is why I went to protest to the chairman who was surprised that we all did not have copies and the deputy chairman told us that within five minutes from when we started we would all have copies but that did not happen.”  Copyright PUNCH.

The National President SSASOGA Similoluwa Onabanjo who said this in Ibadan on Thursday stated that holding social functions in schools exposed students especially female ones to many dangers. She spoke after the inauguration of various projects executed by the association at Saint Anne’s School Molete Ibadan. The projects are: the furnishing of a classroom block and staff room; purchase of windows and doors as well as painting of Junior Secondary School 1; the replacement of wooden windows with iron; incinerator; landscaping; and the donation of 26 desks. The association also laid the foundation to build an archive and museum for the school. Speaking on the security situation at the school Onabanjo said there were many entry points into the school urging that the fence be mended to prevent unwanted visitors from entering the school. She said “You can’t control who comes in when parties are going on here and these are young girls who are vulnerable. We need to protect them from sexual predators. “They should stop renting the place out for parties. Is it N20000 that they collect for renting this place out that is their problem? When you charge N20000 you expose the lives of about 5000 children to danger. That is not fair. “There is nobody among us that will leave their house open and allow anybody to go in. This environment should be made less porous to invaders.” Onabanjo said some structures in the school were very old and dilapidated urging the government to consider the school for renovation. She said the authorities should eject those occupying the school hostels for new ones to be built adding that accommodations should be provided on the school premises for teachers particularly those not living in Ibadan. Also Onabanjo said SSASOGA was ready to assist only “serious” pupils with scholarships. The Director and Zonal Inspector of Education Ibadan Zone 1 Mr Victor Olugbemi who read the address of the Office of the Oyo State Commissioner for Education Science and Technology lauded SSASOGA for its sacrifices to ensure that the school remains one of the best in the world. He said “The project being inaugurated today without mincing words must have gulped millions of naira time and commitment. But let me remind you that the generations behind you will continue to pray for you. “It is our hope that when the archive and museum building is completed it will go a long way in shaping the minds of the students in the documentation of the history of the school while the furnished classrooms and staffroom will add value to the teaching and learning processes as well as motivate the teachers.”  Copyright PUNCH.

Campaign for Democracy in a statement signed by its Deputy President Mr Obatungashe Adebayo pondered when it became a crime to embark on self-determination struggle and peaceful protest when the rights to freedom of assembly were enshrined in both local and international laws. The group said “We do not know when it became a crime for patriotic Nigerians to exercise such rights in a peaceful manner. We are tempted to believe that the bedlam happening in the North-Eastern North-Western and South-Eastern parts of the country is gradually being extended to the South-West which is the most peaceful region and where foreign investors hibernate to carry out their businesses. “It will be commendable and more appreciable if our security operatives could channel their energy and also display the same desperation through which they kill innocent and patriotic Nigerians to the fight against against bandits and Boko Haram. “The killing of the innocent young girl practically attests to the general belief that the operators of our democracy don’t attach premium to human life.” The Campaign for Democracy however called for a thorough investigation into the alleged police shooting of protesters at Ojota which sadly led to the killing of the victim. A yoghurt seller identified simply as Jumoke had been reported killed by bullets reportedly fired by a security operative dispersing Yoruba Nation agitators at Ojota Lagos on Saturday. It was reported that the girl’s corpse had her stomach ripped open by live bullets. She was reportedly displaying drinks at a shop when the bullets hit her. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

El-Rufai said the school had been threatened by three banditry groups and that he was concerned about the safety of lives of the pupils and teachers. Sadiq was enrolled in the school in 2019. El-Rufai said the banditry groups were planning to attack the school and kidnap his son according to security reports made available to him. The governor who  disclosed this in an interview with BBC Pidgin also revealed that he even enrolled Sadiq’s younger sister Nasrin when she marked her six birthday but that the security reports forced him to “temporarily” withdraw both children. He said his children were being homechooled and only going to  school to take their examinations. He however said they would return to the school when the security situation improved. El-Rufai said “My son and my daughter are registered in the school. We also registered Sadiq’s sister in the school when she clocked six. But we had to temporarily withdraw them for the sake of the security of the school because we received security reports that three (banditry) groups were planning to attack the school and kidnap my son. “I don’t think they (kidnappers) would have succeeded because there are enough security agents in the school to prevent them. But it would expose other pupils to danger.

Narrating her encounter with Dr. Gbadegeshin the patient told our correspondent “I did not suspect that I was in for a rough time when the doctor shunned my greeting as I entered his consulting room. He just buried his face in his laptop and kept typing as I explained my health concerns. “He then asked me to lie down on the examination table which I did with my blouse taken off. “After he had examined my frontal part he ordered me to lie face down. I did with a little difficulty as I was mindful of my aching back. “Dr. Gbadegeshin went ahead to hit certain parts in my back starting from the top. As he continued downward I attempted to tell him that some spots he was hitting were painful but he shut me up saying he was watching my face to see my reaction. “He then folded one of my legs which impacted painfully on my back; at the same time he pressed my aching lower back firmly to the examination table and I screamed out in excruciating pain. “Dr. Gbadegeshin ignored my pain and went for the second leg while his other hand was still pressed to my lower back. “At that point the pain had become unbearable and I appealed to my attending physician to give me a moment’s respite.   Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"610","headline":"Nigeria ranks 47th on UN’s cybersecurity index","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/nigeria-ranks-47th-on-uns-cybersecurity-index","stories":"Nigeria ranked 47th out of 182 countries on the Global Cybersecurity Index for 2020 and occupied the fourth position in Africa. The GCI is an initiative of the International Telecommunication Union the United Nations specialised agency for Information and Communications Technology. It was first launched in 2015 by the ITU to measure the commitment of 193 ITU member states and the State of Palestine to cybersecurity. It was to serve as means to help the member states identify areas of improvement and encourage countries to take action through raising awareness on the state of cybersecurity worldwide. The evolution of cybersecurity risks priorities and resources has also led GCI to adapt to give an accurate snapshot of cybersecurity measures taken by countries. Mauritius Tanzania and Ghana are the top three nations in Africa while Nigeria Kenya Benin Rwanda South Africa Uganda and Zambia make up the top 10 African countries. According to the report in 2007 there were a billion people online and the amount of data created was about 255 exabytes. With the advent of smartphones and social media there are now about 3.5 billion people online with about 44 zettabytes amount of data created. The report said as the COVID-19 pandemic began to take hold in April 2020 Internet traffic increased by 30 per cent. From telecommuting to remote learning technology played a key role in keeping people connected and for the digital age to realise its potential a trusted and safe cyberspace must be key. “Global losses due to cybercrime is estimated from as low as $1tn in 2020 to as high as $6tn in 2021” the report said. Based on the report the World Economic Forum estimates that approximately one million people go online for the first time each day and two-thirds of the global population owns a mobile device. And while the advantage of digital technology brings immense economic and societal benefits cyber risks can quickly erode the benefits of digitalization. Countries that rank low on GCI are more likely to be least developed countries and to have a high percentage of their populations unconnected. As more people in these countries begin to become more connected they would need support to develop cybersecurity capacity to better respond to threats. However countries like this are likely to face resource challenges in bridging their cyber-capacity gap including a lack of institutional knowledge policy limitations skills shortages among others to protect their ICT systems both physically and virtually. The report said that there would be 3.5 million to 4 million cybersecurity jobs left unfilled globally in 2021. It said despite this gap a significant number of countries were yet to develop sector-specific training and over 50 per cent of countries lack programmes tailored towards specific sectors or professions such as law enforcement legal actors Small and medium-sized enterprises private companies and government officials. According to the report cybersecurity is continually evolving behaviours and practices. It said when the Sustainable Development Goals come to maturity in 2030 90 per cent of the projected world population or 7.5 billion people are projected to be online with an estimated 24.1 billion to 125 billion Internet of Things devices connected.  Copyright PUNCH.

Alleged killer of Super TV CEO booked apartment with fake name Jewel","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/revealed-alleged-killer-of-super-tv-ceo-booked-apartment-with-fake-name-jewel","stories":"A preliminary police report on the alleged murder of Super TV Chief Executive Officer Usifo Ataga has shown that the prime suspect Chidinma Ojukwu used the name ‘Jewel’ to book the short let apartment on Adebowale Oshin Street Lekki Phase I Lagos where Ataga was killed. The report also indicated that several calls placed to a phone number with which 21-year-old Ojukwu booked didn’t go through after Ataga’s body was discovered in the room on Wednesday June 16. Ojukwu a 300-level Mass Communication student of the University of Lagos had reportedly checked into the service apartment with Ataga to have fun. What started as an amorous encounter however went awry under the influence of drugs as Ojukwu reportedly stabbed her lover multiple times with a knife. The young lady who fled the scene of the crime and withdrew a sum of N380000 from the victim’s account with his ATM card was eventually tracked down by the police at her father’s residence on Akinwunmi Street Alagomeji Yaba on Wednesday June 23. Chidinma had confessed to the crime while she was being paraded at the state police command headquarters in Ikeja attributing her action to the influence of hard drugs and alcohol. Items recovered from the suspect included a Nigerian passport with No B50010434 a fake driving licence bearing ‘Mary Johnson’ with the suspect’s photograph an Access Bank statement of account slip a UBA (United Bank for Africa) ATM debit card bearing her name and a UNILAG identity card. Meanwhile a report of preliminary investigation into the alleged murder indicated that Ojukwu checked into the hotel using a foreign phone number and a pseudonym identified only as Jewel. It stated that she invited the late Ataga into the apartment on Tuesday June 15 while the man was found dead around 1pm the following day by a worker who wanted to clean the room. The incident was said to have been reported to the police by the operator of the facility Mrs Nkechi Mogbo. The report read in part “Mogbo reported that around 3pm of June 16 2021 she received a call from her security guard on Adebowale Oshin Street Lekki Phase I where she has one flat being used as a short let apartment. She further stated that the security man informed her that one Jewel with a foreign phone number who rented the apartment invited one Usifo Ataga to the apartment yesterday (June 15) and that about  1pm of June 16 when the cleaner wanted to clean the room he discovered that the door had been broken. “When she (the cleaner) peeped into the room she discovered that the said Ataga was lying in a pool of blood. All calls put across to the said Jewel to come back to the apartment proved abortive.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Ejiofor stated this while giving an update of the case on Friday evening on Twitter. He wrote “My client Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was actually abducted by the accursed Kenya’s Special Police Force on the 18th of June 2021 at their International Airport and consequently taken to an undisclosed residence under dehumanising conditions. “He was tortured and subjected to all forms of inhuman treatment which worsened his health condition. He was illegally detained for eight good days in Kenya before being transferred to their Nigerian counterpart. “He was purportedly investigated on a bogus charge while in their custody ostensibly awaiting to be handed over after their findings proved him innocent of all the spurious allegations. They later beckoned on their Nigerian counterpart to take over. “The Kenya government was deeply involved in the abduction detention and ill-treatment of my client before the illegal handover to their Nigerian counterpart.” Ejiofor also alleged that the health condition of the IPOB leader was deteriorating claiming that a scan showed his heart had widened by 13 per cent as a result of how he was handled by the Kenyan government. He added “A scan of his heart showed that the heart has enlarged by 13 per cent due to the dehumanising treatment meted out to him. There will be a need for immediate proper medical examination and attention for him. “Mazi Nnamdi Kanu conveyed his goodwill message to all IPOB family members worldwide and craved your unrelentless prayers. We are going back to the court for the needful. Other details cannot be entertained here. His fortified legal team will address these infractions at the proper forum as we progress. Other details on our legal strategy may not be made public. “With Chukwuokike Abiama on our side victory is assured. For if God Almighty be for us who can be against us? ”  Kanu who is being prosecuted on charges of treasonable felony was rearrested after jumping bail and repatriated to Nigeria on Sunday. Meanwhile Kenya has denied involvement in the arrest and extradition of Nnamdi Kanu  the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra. The Kenyan High Commissioner to Nigeria  Amb. Wilfred Machage who expressed displeasure over reports that Kanu was arrested in his country admonished Nigerians to ask the Federal Government how the IPOB leader was apprehended. Kanu’s brother Kingsley had alleged that the IPOB leader who jumped bail in 2017 was nabbed in Kenya and extradited to Nigeria on Sunday. A national daily (Not The PUNCH) reported that the Kenyan President Uhuru  kenyatta was privy to Kanu’s extradition. But addressing journalists in Abuja on Friday the Kenyan envoy dismissed the allegations and challenged anyone with evidence linking his country to the incident to produce it. He described as unfortunate and libelous the linking of President  Kenyatta to Kanu’s arrest. Machage stated”I wish to categorically state that we are not happy at this ridiculous attempt of dragging the name of Kenya and President Uhuru Kenyatta in this matter of arrest and extradition of the self-proclaimed IPOB leader.” Meanwhile IPOB said Kanu had refused to eat for seven days for fear of being poisoned in the custody of the Department of State Services. The group’s Media and Public Secretary Emma Powerful in a statement made available to Saturday PUNCH said any plans “to inject our leader with poisonous vaccine that will make him die slowly” would lead to “unimaginable consequences.” It expressed regret that Kanu was being denied access to his family members doctors and lawyers warning that “Nnamdi Kanu must not die in custody!” The statement read in part “Following the refusal of the Nigeria Government and its wicked security agency the Department of State Services to allow our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s lawyers and family access to him in the dungeon of DSS’ secret cell it is now confirmed that their real intention in kidnapping him and bundling him back to Nigeria is to kill him. “The mission they could not actualise in September 14 2017 when soldiers invaded his Afaraukwu home during Operation Python Dance is what they want to actualise now. “His health has been deteriorating in the DSS cell as he has refused to eat their food for almost one week since they kidnapped him. We demand that DSS should allow him access to his lawyers and family members for this is his lawful right. “His lawyers are being harassed and we pity them and Nigeria if anything happens to our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. The Nigeria Government and security agencies must understand the product we are made of and how prepared we are.” The proscribed group in its statement urged South-East governors Ohaneze Ndigbo and politicians in the region to ensure that no harm came to Kanu alleging that “Miyetti Allah and sympathisers of terrorists are going free in the country but ordinary persons and innocent citizens are being molested every day because they are Biafrans.” IPOB added “The Fulani- controlled Federal Government of Nigeria and DSS should release our leader for international medical check-up. He must have access to his doctors to ascertain his current health status since he was abducted and tortured by the security agents. “We declare without equivocation that the Nigerian government should not take our calmness for granted. Should anything untoward happen to our leader while in detention or even after we will totally cripple Nigeria and its government! “Our intelligence units are following the events including the torture being meted out to him since his abduction. The world should see how the wicked Nigerian government is provoking us. “While Boko Haram terrorists and bandits maiming and killing indigenous Nigerians in their ancestral lands are made to go free and even the few captured ones are released and given cash after sumptuous treatment in detention an innocent freedom fighter is made to languish in detention. “His lawyers are being harassed also. This is unacceptable! The world should not pretend about this injustice!” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The government made the appeal in a statement issued by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary Kunle Somorin on Friday. The government said one Pastor Kunle Garb a resident of Igbokofi village in the Yewa North Local Government Area of the state was abducted at the village market last week by gendarmes (Beninese police). The statement said that the Benin Republic police reportedly crossed illegally into the Nigerian territory to carry out the daring act after scaring away traders and other Nigerians at the market. The statement read “Pastor Garb an activist who has been consistently campaigning against the incessant harassment of Nigerians by the Beninese in attempts to forcefully annex the Nigerian territory was taken away in a Gestapo manner by the armed security agents from the neighbouring country. “Pastor Garb has since been charged and remanded under inhuman conditions in the Benin Republic and prevented from having access to his lawyers doctors and members of his family. “In a protest to the Federal Government Gov Dapo Abiodun narrated the ordeal of Nigerians living in the border towns of the state and Benin Republic. He also called for prompt actions by relevant federal authorities to prevent further harassment of Nigerian citizens and encroachment on the Nigerian territorial borders. “The governor also called on the National Boundary Commission to step up actions to clearly demarcate Nigeria’s international borders with Benin Republic while calling on Nigeria’s security agents to properly secure Nigerians in the border communities and our country’s borders with the neighbouring country.”    Copyright PUNCH.

The deceased is survived by an aged mother wife three children and siblings. During a visit to Peter Ajibola Street Osogbo where the house is located about five vehicles belonging to mourners were parked in front of a one-storey building occupied by the family. Some sympathisers were seen in front of the house discussing the incident. All the residents approached by our correspondent declined comments but they were observed discussing the death in hushed tones. A friend of the deceased simply identified as George described Adekunle as “jovial and pleasant” adding that “contrary to whatever opinion anyone may hold of him he was a peaceful person.” “Ask about him on Peter Ajibola’s Street where his family lives they will tell you he was a peaceful and generous man. He should not have been killed by those that did it.” Another friend of the deceased who preferred anonymity condemned the approach adopted by the security men and demanded the whereabouts of his corpse.

{"id":"653","headline":"Police in show of force as agitator insists on Lagos rally today","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/police-in-show-of-force-as-agitator-insists-on-lagos-rally-today","stories":"Barring any last-minute change agitators of the Yoruba nation and men of the Lagos State Police Command may be at loggerheads as the demonstrators embark on a mega rally in the state today against police order. The agitators had insisted on holding the rally despite police warnings to shelve the plan. The rally was organised by Chief Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho and the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups Ilana Omo Oodua led by a renowned historian and former senator Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye. Igboho had initially suspended the rally after operatives of the DSS laid siege to his residence in the Soka area of Ibadan around 1 am on Thursday killing two persons and arresting 13 others. The Yoruba Council of Elders and Afenifere leader Chief Ayo Adebanjo had slammed the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for the attack on Igboho’s home urging the Federal Government to investigate the attack and bring those behind it to justice. On Thursday the Lagos State Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu warned organisers of the planned Yoruba Nation rally and their followers to stay off the streets of Lagos adding that anyone caught would be dealt with according to the law. Odumosu said intelligence reports available to the police indicated that some people had perfected plans to infiltrate the protesters and cause mayhem in the state. The CP reiterated the warning in a statement on Friday by the Police Public Relations Officer in the state CSP Muyiwa Adejobi just as a number of policemen embarked on a show of force across the state to deter the agitators. The armed policemen moved round some parts of the state on Friday in armoured vehicles and patrol vans. The statement read in part “The command and the government of Lagos State had warned the organisers of the planned Oodua Republic Mega Rally scheduled for Saturday 3rd July 2021 at Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park Ojota to steer clear of Lagos State considering the available intelligence reports on the planned rally and to forestall any breakdown of law and order. “The command and other security agencies including the Nigerian Army Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps Federal Road Safety Corps and Department of State Services have however put measures in place to prevent any act of lawlessness oppression and intimidation of any kind in the state on the said date 3rd July 2021 and beyond as Lagos State cannot afford to record and experience the violence orchestrated by some individuals during the 2020 #EndSARS protest that led to massive destruction of lives and properties in the state.” However the Ilana Omo Oodua insisted on Friday that the rally would hold as scheduled. The group’s General Secretary George Akinola said it was the responsibility of the police to protect protesters and all law-abiding people saying the group had held the same rally in other states in the South-West without being hijacked by hoodlums. He said “We have read what the police said and they did not even say our planned rally is illegal. They talked about hoodlums and also talked traffic jam.  “It is the duty of the police to ensure that hoodlums do not infiltrate us. We have held our rally in other states and none of it was hijacked. The police in Lagos State should also not allow this one to be hijacked. We will cooperate with the police. “Politicians religious organisations and others hold rallies and processions in Lagos and they were not stopped because of traffic jam. We are not going to disturb other people so we will cooperate with the police. We are calling on the police to protect us on Saturday. It will hold on Saturday but the venue will be communicated later.” Policemen stationed on rally ground One of our correspondents who visited Ojota on Friday evening saw about 18 policemen around the Gani Fawehinmi Park and M.K.O. Abiola Gardens. Nine fully-armed policemen were seen stationed around the park with an unmarked Sienna car with the inscription ‘Police Ogudu Division’ a Mitsubishi bus with the inscription ‘Anti-crime Area Hotel’ and two motorbikes boldly bearing ‘police’. An open van fully-loaded with policemen numbering over 13 was also seen patrolling the area. Some of the policemen were conducting a stop-and-search on cars as they questioned a few passersby. When asked if the police presence in the area was a regular occurrence an attendant at a filling station who spoke on condition of anonymity said “Normally policemen used to be stationed around Abiola Gardens where they arrest suspected Yahoo boys (Internet fraudsters) but I am surprised why they are on patrol. They have been doing so since I resumed duty.” Also in a live Facebook broadcast monitored by Saturday PUNCH on Friday  Igboho’s spokesperson Olayomi Koiki maintained that the rally would hold as planned adding that Igboho would be back stronger. He said “I can still confirm officially that the Lagos rally irrespective of whatever news or rumours you’ve been listening to from different outlets will go as planned. The 3rd of July mega rally will go on as planned. All arrangements for the rally have been planned and nothing has changed. “I have spoken to the organisers nothing has changed so far. On the 3rd of July from exactly 9 am [the rally will start]. The whole arrangement and planning are going on. I’ve spoken with the General Secretary of Ilana Omo Odua George Akinola and Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye and he (Akintoye) is working tirelessly for the release of those taken away.” “The rally in Lagos is going to be a peaceful rally it is going to be a mega rally; do not be disturbed about what happened. So many developments took place at Igboho’s house.” He said Igboho urged the people not to be weighed down about the attack in his house noting that “he is standing with the Yoruba Nation agenda.”    Copyright PUNCH.

Tompolo who is also the Ibe-Ebidouwei of the Ijaw Nation in a statement on Friday said ”There is much bitterness in the land owing to the lackadaisical attitude of this government in handling matters of great importance to its citizens.” Tompolo expressed concern that despite a consultative meeting between major stakeholders from the Niger Delta and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Senator Godswill Akpabio where a truce was reached to suspend an earlier ultimatum given to the government on the issue of the Niger Delta Development Commission the government had failed to keep to its pledge to constitute the NDDC board in June. He said “June 2021 has come to an end. The people of the region have yet to see any tangible move towards the constitution of the NDDC board by the Federal Government. The people are seriously agitated. There is palpable fear and tension in the region. “I wish to reiterate my earlier position that the government should as a matter of urgency constitute the substantive board of the NDDC to avoid unnecessary bickering and crisis in the region. Since I reluctantly accepted the outcome of the consultative meeting I have done so much to keep peace in the region which some major stakeholders in the security circle are aware of. “I have been in constant touch with my fellow agitators in the region to give peace a chance knowing full well that there cannot be any meaningful development in an atmosphere of rancour and acrimony. “As it stands now the one thing the government must do in this issue is to be courageous enough to constitute the NDDC board. The government must be sincere in handling developmental issues in the Niger Delta region as the people have suffered enough being neglected for several decades.” Copyright PUNCH.

He also said that the way bandits and Boko Haram terrorists’ operate was  different from that of the proscribed IPOB led by Kanu. Speaking to BBC Pidgin El-Rufai stated that bandits were not calling for the break-up of Nigeria but only carrying out their activities as a form of business. He said unlike IPOB led by Kanu bandits have no centralised leadership. The governor said “I was very happy (when Nnamdi Kanu was arrested) because first he jumped bail jeopardising his sureties. “Second a person that challenges the sovereignty and the authority of a state and incites violence; he refers to his own country as a zoo. “This should be a message to all these separatists challenging the authority of the Nigerian state to be very careful.” Asked if Boko Haram and bandits should be treated with the same swiftness that led to Kanu’s arrest El-Rufai said “No! No! No! No! People are comparing apples to oranges. “Nnamdi Kanu is the leader of IPOB a proscribed organisation. He is identifiable in constant communication and everyone knows where he is. “Let’s take Boko Haram for instance. Shekau was in hiding and for the past 10 years and the military had been waging a war to get him. “It is not like Shekau was in Saudi Arabia sitting in one place tweeting about the break-up of Nigeria or asking Boko Haram to go and kill Helen and Nasir el-Rufai. “Nnamdi Kanu is in one place while Shekau is waging guerrilla warfare. The insurgency is still going on and the Federal Government is not giving up. “Regarding bandits they are not centralised under one leadership. Who is the head of the bandits? Who is the equivalent of Nnandi Kanu with banditry? “Bandits are just collections of independent criminals. It is a business for them. It is not a case of Nigeria must break up. “I want to challenge anyone to tell me the central leader of bandits in the same position as Kanu.”   Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

NNPC said on Friday that the agreements were part of the corporation’s gas commercialisation programme and involved Total Exploration and Production Nigeria China National Offshore Oil Corporation South Atlantic Petroleum Nigeria Limited and Prime 130 Limited. It said in a statement issued in Abuja that the sale structure under which the agreements were executed was designed to provide a clear delineation for the allocation of the gas sale proceeds to all the participating parties including midstream handling and transportation. NNPC’s Group Managing Director Mele Kyari was quoted as saying “This is a very proud moment for all of us. I understand all the delays they are completely unavoidable. It is desirable for us to have full alignment of all parties before we proceed. “The end result is that there would be clarity around our relationship and we would be unlocking resources that have been on the table for many years. “We now have a clear line of sight around gas revenue of up to $250m and also another $510m that is applicable to the rest of us.” He noted that apart from the revenue boost the agreements had also opened up an opportunity to have the dispute settlement agreement for the OML 130 PSC and ultimately to have a renewed production sharing contract which would guide the relationship going forward. On the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill Kyari assured the parties that the fiscal terms proposed in the oil reform legislation remained some of the most attractive in the global oil and gas industry noting that investors had no cause to worry. The Managing Director TEPNG Mike Sangster said all parties were committed to the terms of the agreements. OML 130 is a deepwater block located 130km offshore Niger Delta at water depths of well over 1000m.    Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"664","headline":"Methodist Prelate kicks as British church adopts gay marriage","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/methodist-prelate-kicks-as-british-church-adopts-gay-marriage","stories":"The Methodist Church Nigeria has denounced the adoption of same-sex marriage by the Methodist Church in Britain. The British Methodist Church on Wednesday became the largest religious denomination in that country to permit same-sex marriage after a vote to change the definition of marriage at the Methodist Conference overwhelmingly passed by 254 in favour with 46 against. Church officials hope the first same-sex weddings in Methodist chapels will take place later this year according to the British Broadcasting Corporation. However freedom of conscience clauses mean ministers will not be forced to conduct such weddings if they oppose the move. Same-sex marriage is not allowed in the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. But the Prelate Methodist Church Nigeria Dr Samuel Uche in a release made available by the Director Media and Public relation Rev. Oladapo Daramola stated that the recent development applied only to British Methodist. He said “There is a raging controversy now and people’s feelings are dampened over the decision of the British conference majority not all of them to legalise (sic) same-sex marriage. This is for the British Methodist Church. The British Methodist Church is no longer the mother church of Methodist Church Nigeria. “Methodist Church Nigeria became independent autonomous and autocephalous around 1962\/63. Therefore any decision they take there is not binding on Methodist Church Nigeria. We are not under their tutelage and we are not under their administration. “We as Methodist Church Nigeria condemn in totality anything (condoning) gay relationships or marriage. It is un-African it is even against the law passed by the National Assembly of Nigeria which was duly signed and even when the present President was asked to reverse it he said no.” The cleric stated that the Methodist Church Nigeria adopted the Bible in its totality saying the Bible could not be rewritten. He further reiterated the “sound doctrines” delivered by John Wesley whom he said believed in scriptural holiness and evangelical faith. He said “We believe in the holiness of God. God is holy and God said the man and the woman shall be one not that man and man should marry. The historical antecedent of the Methodist Church Movement by John and Charles Wesley and George Whitefield and their group is where we stand. It is irrevocable. “We cannot go back to Egypt we cannot go back to what we rejected. What the British Church has done does not in any way apply to Methodist Church Nigeria. I want illustrious Nigerians and our teeming members to understand that there is no cause for alarm.” “Let them continue worshipping God in spirit and in truth. If anybody is discovered to be aiding and abetting or contemplating to practise gay (lifestyle) in Methodist Church Nigeria that person will be excommunicated from the church” he added.

Spokesman for the NSCDC in Kwara State Afolabi Babawale said this in a statement on Thursday said “the old man complained bitterly that his son Kehinde has been stealing his money for some time now and recently he stole the sum of N44000 from his room and all his efforts to reform him has proved abortive.” Babawale said that after thorough investigation by operatives of NSCDC Kehinde confessed that he stole his father’s money adding that a sum of N33000 was recovered from him while he said that he had spent the balance. He said that Kehinde had been transferred to the NSCDC Kwara State Command Guidance and Rehabilitation Unit where HE was being rehabilitated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"671","headline":"2023: For equity justice power must shift to South says ex-Borno gov Shettima","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/2023-for-equity-justice-power-must-shift-to-south-says-ex-borno-gov-shettim","stories":"A  former Borno State Governor Kashim Shettima has called for a power shift to the southern part of Nigeria in 2023. Shettima made the call in Abuja on Friday at the public presentation of the book titled ‘Standing for the Truth with Courage.’ The book was written by Prof. Emeritus Njidda Gadzama who is the Chairman of the TETfund Research and Development Standing Committee. The book prescribed as a resource material on the culture and language of the Margi people in Borno is a story of Gadzama covering details of special events in his life. The former governor stressing that the hope of the country rested on the mindset of its people said the problem was not religion or ethnicity but people using it to achieve their goals the News Agency of Nigeria reported. “I believe in equity justice and fairness. After power has resided in the North for eight years there is the need for a power shift in the South” he said. Shettima said there was a need for the country to inculcate the culture of writing books to enhance the academic performance of students. Prof. Ibrahim Gambari the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari called for unity and peaceful co-existence of Nigerians. Gambari said the best way to guarantee unity of Nigeria was for all the people to come together while commending Gadzama for using his experience to illustrate the importance of standing for truth in his book. “We are going through difficult times in our country economic and security but let us recognise that the whole world is going through the same challenge. “Nigeria is part of the world. But the leadership under which we operate shows we shall indeed overcome all these. If we keep united keep building we cannot be ignored by any other country in the world. “I am convinced that under the leadership of president Buhari there is going to be a better future. He belongs to all Nigerians” he said. Responding Gadzama noted that his experience at the 13 Working Groups of TETfund research committee had deepened his faith in Nigeria that “we can make it as a nation’’. According to him Nigeria is a beautiful country that nothing should divide on ethnic lines. ”The intelligent people of Nigeria have great potential together develop the country. “As a member of a minority tribe in the North I invariably will learn Hausa language early. But if I were younger  I will want to learn to speak Igbo and Yoruba languages so that I will move around as a local native freely in Nigeria. “Members of the major tribal languages too should learn one major language with one minority language as there are many (250) to pick from. “That way in 100 years maybe we will evolve a language that is owned by all of us” he said. Meanwhile Prof. Suleiman Bogoro the Executive Secretary TETFund commended Gadzama’s strides toward ensuring that research and development was taken to greater heights in the country. Copyright PUNCH.

The court also made an order prohibiting the Nigerian Police Force and Okeke from taking any steps to prosecute the individuals over the #EndSARS protest. Justice Bello Kawu while delivering the order on Friday stated that the suit that was filed in a representative capacity by a human rights activist Deji Adeyanju was proper in law. He stated that the High Court of the FCT has supervisory jurisdiction over the Magistrate Court against the suit by Okeke. Okeke had sued fifty individuals including celebrities and activists at the FCT Magistrate Court Wuse Zone 6 for supporting the #EndSARS protest through their tweets and physical involvement. The individuals included the Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre Sam Adeyemi Kanu Nwankwo Innocent Idibia (2face) David Adeleke (Davido) Aisha Yesufu Kiki Mordi Peter Okoye Paul Okoye Deji Adeyanju Tiwa Savage Folarin Falana (Falz) Feyikemi Abudu and Debo Adebayo (Mr. Macaroni) and others. The counsel to Adeyanju and 49 others Samuel Ihensekhien stated that the decision meant victory for the ordinary man. Ihensekhien also stated that it was a landmark decision that establishes that peaceful protest is not a crime in Nigeria. “By virtue of today’s ruling his motion of dismissal of this substantive case has been dismissed by the honourable FCT High Court. The consequence of it is that the court will hear the substantive application to formally dismiss the pending criminal complaint and charge before the Magistrate’s court” Ihensekhien added. “We are so happy and justice can still be found in Nigeria in spite of the elaborate and extensive arguments over whether this case should be dismissed or not. Thank God the court held in our favour and we are so grateful.” The court adjourned the matter to September 7.    Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"673","headline":"Gombe raises district village heads’ salaries after 17 years","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/gombe-raises-district-village-heads-salaries-after-17-years","stories":"No fewer than 165 district heads and 602 village heads within the 11 local government areas of Gombe State are to benefit from a salary raise by the state government after 17 years of no salary increment. Announcing the decision at a press briefing on Friday the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs Ibrahim Waziri said this increment would help boost the performance of the traditional leaders. Findings by our correspondent showed that prior to this review district heads earned N26000 while village heads earned about N23000 monthly. The last time the state had a review was in 2005 even though the district heads were promoted from Grade Level 6 Step 1 to Grade Level 12 Step 1. Village heads had also been promoted from Grade Level 3 Step 1 to Grade Level 8 Step 1. Speaking on the salary increase Waziri said it was to fulfil the government’s promises to the traditional rulers and boost their morale. Commending the government the District Head Dukku Emirate Council Kamalu Gurama said the salary increment would go a long way in improving their services to the people. “District heads had been collecting about N26000 and village heads about N23000. Now it has increased by about 50 per cent. Personally I’m now expecting about N56000 or more per month plus N15000 monthly as imprest” he said.    Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The House also passed into law the bill on judicial autonomy and the bill on violence against persons. The bills were passed after the chairmen of three committees on the bills submitted their reports. The plenary of the Assembly held on Thursday was presided over by the Speaker Mr Bamidele Oloyeloogun. Speaking on the bills at the session the committee chairmen remarked that the bills were in the best interest of all citizens of Ondo State. On the anti-open grazing bill the House Committee on Agriculture Mr Taofik Mohammed explained that the bill was to regulate the rearing and grazing of livestock to prevent the destruction of farm crops and end crises between farmers and herders as well as support the growth of livestock farming in the state. He also said the bill would promote modern techniques of animal husbandry. The Chairman House Committee on Selection and Deputy Speaker of the Assembly Mr Samuel Aderoboye stated that the Judicial Autonomy Bill would regulate activities regarding the judiciary fund management in line with the objective of the law.

{"id":"675","headline":"Polygamy not solution to infidelity –Jaiye Kuti","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/polygamy-not-solution-to-infidelity-jaiye-kuti","stories":"In the wake of the murder of a businessman and the Chief Executive Officer of Super TV Usifo Ataga by his lover Chidinma Ojukwu many have said that it is better for a man to marry more than one wife rather than keep mistresses. However in an interview with Saturday Beats actress Jaiye Kuti disagreed with the notion that polygamy was a solution to infidelity. She said “I don’t think polygamy will solve the issues. Polygamy will rather lead to other issues and the society is aware of that. That is why we chose monogamy over polygamy. I don’t see polygamy as a solution. Discipline and loving one’s neighbour as oneself is the solution.” The actress also advised people not to believe everything they saw regarding the lives of popular people. She said “Everyone wants to be famous and they do everything to keep up appearances. Don’t believe all the alleged success stories you see everywhere. They may seem perfect. But you can only see things from outside. You don’t have to be a cynic. Just don’t take appearance for facts. Celebrities may have contributed in a little way (to people wanting to get rich by all means) but I think the terrible economic situation has contributed much more. “The poverty in the land is making young people and everyone else as a matter of fact to seek any way possible to escape it. Therefore some people are going the ‘sugar daddy’ way. Men should also consider that these young women could be their daughters and they don’t need to have an affair with them before they can help them.” Kuti also emphasised the need for parents to be vigilant when raising their children. She said “With or without the unfortunate incident of the Super TV CEO parents must always monitor their children and more importantly live a life that can encourage their children to live decently and content.” The actress also urged the police to carry out proper investigations on the case. She said “The murder of the Super TV CEO should be properly investigated because it looks like there’s more to the issue than meets the eyes.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"676","headline":"Lagos seals 13 buildings serves seven enforcement notices","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/lagos-seals-13-buildings-serves-seven-enforcement-notices","stories":"The Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority on Thursday sealed no fewer than 13 buildings while serving seven others contravention notices during an enforcement exercise within Ikeja and its environs. The exercise was conducted by the monitoring compliance unit of LASPPPA alongside officers of the Nigerian Police Force under its special operations unit as well as officials from the Lagos State Building Control Agency. Some of the buildings affected were located in Ikeja including Isaac John Street Joel Ogunnaike Street and Sowemimo Street. The exercise also extended to Peace Estate Maryland. Speaking on the purpose of the exercise LASPPPA General Manager Kehinde Osinaike said that the exercise was necessary following repeated violation of the state’s town planning laws. Osinaike said “We have observed over time that there are many illegal developments within GRA Ikeja and this is not good for our environment. “We have the town planning regulations and laws governing every form of physical development in the state and we have to ensure that people adhere to these regulations.” On whether prior notice was given before the exercise Osinnaike said “Since last year we have tried to serve all the necessary notices as provided for in the regulation including the contravention notices stop work orders and the quit notices. “Unfortunately we are dealing with developers and property owners that are very recalcitrant who are not ready to do things according to the law and this can’t continue. “The GRA is supposed to be a well planned area. Unfortunately because of the inordinate ambition of some developers they’ve bastardised the area. This exercise will continue as long as people keep flouting the town planning laws.” The GM disclosed that engagements had been held with the GRA Ikeja Residents Association and some other critical stakeholders prior to the exercise. On whether demolitions would occur he said “It depends on the situation we meet on ground. If the situation warrants that we do a token demolition we are not going to hesitate to do that.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"677","headline":"My marriage…With Dele Odule","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/my-marriage-with-dele-odule-2","stories":"For how long have you been married? Officially we have been married for 25 years. It’s a bit not so straightforward. I met my wife in 1989 from then we became friends and thereafter became live-in lovers.  We formalised our marriage in 1996 after she had completed her University education. Before then we were already living together and had children. How did you meet your wife? I met her while I was at Abeokuta Ogun State. She just completed secondary school and was pursuing A levels when we met. We started somehow and it eventually ended up in marriage. What attracted you to her? I saw that she had for her good home training.  I saw love and true Africanness in her and that made me marry her. What vital lessons has marriage taught you? So far I will agree with anybody that marriage is an institution ordained by God for every couple to know each other. It is a school where one continues to learn every day. One can never know it all.  One will keep knowing new sides of one’s partner every day. What is your advice for singles intending to marry soon? Single people who are planning to marry should be careful in choosing who they will go with to the institution. As I said earlier it is an institution that has no graduation date.  You have to continue in that school till death do you apart. Human beings are different. Even when you’re from the same background there is no guarantee that you will behave the same way. I tell people that two things are important in marriage; the first is tolerance and the second is also tolerance. Everybody should learn how to tolerate each other. There is no paradigm of perfection. Man will definitely goof and the woman will also do the same. If you both start to look at perfection from your own view you won’t get it right.  You have to accommodate each other’s imperfections and help one another to be better. Copyright PUNCH.

The family claimed that the late Kelechi went missing while returning to his residence only for his corpse to be discovered at the mortuary of the Federal Medical Centre Umuahia two days later. The only son of the deceased Chibunna Ehieze said on Saturday May 29 his father visited him at the Mission Hill Umuahia where he (Chibunna) was learning a trade. “On our return we boarded a tricycle to our residence at the German Floor area of Amuzukwu Umuahia. “But on approaching Uwalaka Junction there was confusion as we saw people running in different directions. There were also gunshots and we were not aware of what was happening. “At this point the Keke Napep rider made a U-turn in fear telling all passengers to disembark as he was no longer continuing with the journey. “I jumped down from one side of the Keke and ran in one direction while my father ran in another direction” he added. Chibunna said he was surprised when he got home and did not see his father adding that efforts by other family members to locate him were abortive. He said the search continued until someone drew their attention to reports that corpses of some ‘unknown gunmen’ who attacked the State Criminal Investigation Department Umuahia had been dumped at the FMC Umuahia. “On receiving this information we rushed to the FMC on Monday and discovered the lifeless body of my father. “My father was not an unknown gunman and he was not a criminal while alive but a good citizen who cared for his family” he said in tears. He noted that a worker at the FMC told his mother Mrs Ebere Ehieze that the body of their father was dumped by the police. Chibunna appealed to the federal and state governments and good-spirited individuals to assist the family saying the burden of sustaining the family of one boy and four girls was too much for their mother to bear. His mother Ebere and the elder brother of the deceased Uzonna said they had been devastated by the death and demanded justice. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"708","headline":"Olympics: WA disqualifies Nigeria’s 4x400m team","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/olympics-wa-disqualifies-nigerias-4x400m-team","stories":"’Tosin Oluwalowo World Athletics has disqualified the Nigerian women’s 4x400m team from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics following some technical errors in the race where they secured qualification at the Lagos Open Athletics Championships on June 24. The Nigerian quartet – Nse Imaobong Favour Ofili Knowledge Omovoh and Patience Okon-George – ran a Season’s Best 3:26.83 at the event which was held at the Teslim Balogun Stadium Lagos. The win ensured they climbed to 13th on the WA Top List from the 18th position they initially occupied. Though WA did not give reasons for the country’s disqualification findings by our correspondent showed that the result was not ratified by WA who didn’t reflect the qualification results on the Road to Tokyo tool used to determine qualified athletes on their website when the final list was published on Thursday. A source in the Athletics Federation of Nigeria who spoke on condition of anonymity said WA disqualified the race after one of the countries seeking qualification with Nigeria petitioned them over glaring technical errors in the race. “The race has been disqualified; one of the countries on the Top List was pushed out of qualification places while we went up. So the country sent the race video to World Athletics. “In curve races the results don’t count if there are no cones. In Team Nigeria’s case they didn’t put cones where the second leg diverted to lane one that’s the error. “It is a shame that we are saying this out; that people who call themselves professionals handled things this way. It was the same reason they did not accept the Asaba race (2018 African Athletics Championships) once there are no cones round or there are no railings it wouldn’t be accepted” our source said. A coach and statistical analyst Lekan Soetan added “There’s a rule that all races on bends must be run with kerbs to prevent runners from running inside the inner lane. “Meaning there’s no proof that all runners in that race didn’t break the bend rule since there was no kerb on the bend to ascertain that.” Copyright PUNCH.

Bazoum had on Thursday hosted Zulum alongside the Governor of the Diffa region in Niger Republic Isa Lameen; as well as Senator Abubakar Kyari and the Speaker of Borno State House of Assembly Abdulkarim Lawan to a closed door meeting in Diffa. The meeting focused on the repatriation of Nigerian refugees who fled communities in parts of northern Borno State since 2014 as a result of attacks by Boko Haram. The meeting held soon after Zulum and Lameen had received Bazoum at the Tandja Momadou Airport in Diffa. Diffa is located within close proximity to some communities in northern Borno which share land borders with Niger Republic. The governments and citizens of both countries have been collaborating on security and management of refugees who mostly fled from Mobbar Monguno and other local government areas in northern Borno to Diffa. Zulum who spoke to journalist shortly after the meeting said “The meeting is very fruitful; we have taken a number of decisions which include the reparation of Borno citizens back to our communities. These people have been in Niger in the last six years. With significant improvement regarding our security situation our people are now looking forward to returning to their communities. “We will work with all relevant institutions to ensure the safe and dignified return of our citizens.

Abiodun disclosed this during the inauguration of 130 housing units in Kemta Idi Aba in Abeokuta the state capital. The housing project christened Prince Court Estate is the first phase of the 300 detached and semi-detached of two and three-bedroom structures. Abiodun said although shelter was one of the basic needs of human beings it had continued to be one of the most expensive assets to own by individuals adding that his government would harness all resources to provide affordable shelter for the people of Ogun. He said “This is part of our deliberate approach to ensure that Abeokuta the capital city of Ogun State has befitting infrastructure and amenity that will make it stand out as a capital city not only in Nigeria but throughout Africa. We are doing this in collaboration with the United Kingdom’s Future Cities Project.” He added that the Gateway Mortgage Bank had been directed to provide the much needed mortgage for subscribers of the housing units. “Your government is determined to provide 2500 housing units across the state in our first term. This figure is more than all the housing units that all the successive administrations have provided since the creation of our dear state. “We have gone mid-way into actualizing that. A visit to Kobape Ijebu-Ode Sagamu Ilaro and Ota will convince doubting Thomases of our strength of resolve. Earlier in his remarks the Commissioner for Housing Jamiu Omoniyi said the estate which is in the category of affordable housing was built in 92 days and engaged 5040 direct labourers drawn from the locality.

The multinational consulting firm in its ‘Nigeria 2021 CFO Outlook Survey’ report said “Foreign exchange takes the top spot indicating the persistent issues around foreign exchange illiquidity and volatility induced by exogenous factors which have daunted private sector growth. “The naira has seen further depreciation in both the official and parallel market rates by 8.2 per cent and 6.8 per cent to N410 and N502 respectively stoking further concerns around the outlook for foreign exchange rate. Moreso foreign exchange illiquidity has continued to persist due to sustained pressure on foreign reserves (-4.3 per cent year-to-date to $33.8bn).” The report said the increased oil prices and inflows from external borrowings should provide cushioning for the central bank to achieve its exchange rate harmonisation mandate thus providing some respite for businesses. It said “Furthermore we have newcomer COVID-19 as the third most important stay-awake issue knocking off ‘profitability and cost management’ from the list. As the pandemic continues to evolve there has never been a more pressing need for businesses to rethink and reconfigure their businesses for a changed world. “CFOs have highlighted concerns around tax multiplicity aggressive tax collection drive and lack of transparency in customs\/excise administration as their top issues around tax policies in 2021. On tax matters the new tax administration solution (TaxProMax) is expected to optimise the tax payment process by making it easier and faster.” The report said the CFOs identified security infrastructure and power to be the top three matters that the government needed to address to enable ease of doing business spur economic growth and enhance public trust in 2021. It said only infrastructure retained its position in the top three issues when compared with past survey results citing infrastructure macroeconomic environment as well as tax and regulation as key matters. KMPG said the run of events in 2020 such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil price crash exposed fundamental cracks in the country as they negatively impacted government revenues induced recessionary conditions slowed down consumption and trading activities and increased inflation. It noted that the EndSARS protest was an offshoot of the youth’s increased frustration with the government’s inability to improve the socio-economic welfare of the average Nigerian. The report said “Restoring optimism over Nigeria’s economic prospects require increased efforts from both fiscal and monetary perspectives this will restore growth to either the mid-to-high single digit levels observed in the era between 2000 and 2010 or double-digit expansion. “However the time to act is now. The 2020 Global Terrorism Index revealed that Nigeria ranked third for the fifth time since 2015. The country’s growing insecurity issues ranging from banditry terrorism increased kidnapping herder-farmer related violence militant Biafran separatists amongst others had consequential effects as economic impact hit N50tn in March 2021.” The CFOs expressed concerns over the “worsening state of power supply across the country” but commended the efforts of the government towards the launch of private-public partnerships towards reducing the infrastructural deficit. Concerning the African Continental Free Trade Agreement KPMG reported that CFOs called for the creation of policies that would enable Nigerian businesses benefit from the agreement which kicked off on January 1 2021.

He accused Pasquale and Spadaro who are public prosecutors in the criminal prosecution of Eni\/Shell and others for corruption and money laundering of forgery and professional misconduct. Adoke’s position was contained in a petition by his lawyers Gromyko Amedu Solicitors titled: ‘Re: Mohammed Bello Adoke SAN. Complaint of acts of forgery and professional misconduct against Fabio De Pasquale and Sergio Spadaro public prosecutors before the Court of Milan.” The petition dated July 1 2021 was signed by Femi Oboro on behalf of the law firm. Oboro on Adoke’s behalf accused the prosecutors of unlawful acts of intimidation\/threat to life forgery of documents\/evidence intended for unlawful interference with the administration and perversion of the course of justice. He said the prosecutors acted “maliciously and unprofessionally” to the detriment of the former minister despite the fact that he was not a direct party to the criminal prosecution and was not on trial before the Milanese court. He recalled that sometime in May 2016 Adoke met the Italian and Dutch investigators at The Hague Netherlands in respect of OPL 245 settlement agreement of 2011. On the scheduled date he said Adoke was interviewed by Dutch\/Italian investigators in the absence of Pasquale. He added “However on the second day the nature and character of the interview changed with the presence of Fabio De Pasquale who informed our client that he was being interviewed as a suspect. “This was contrary to the intent and purpose of the interview as agreed between our client and the Dutch\/Italian investigators. Since it emerged that Fabio De Pasquale was engaged in an unlawful and deceptive conduct to wit; to commit our client to be interviewed without a prior knowledge that he was a suspect and that his statement was intended for his criminal prosecution by the Italian prosecutor.” Oboro also accused the prosecutors of engaging in unlawful acts of procuring forged documents\/evidence. He also accused them of engaging in unlawful acts of forgery by procuring and stage-managing a phony telephone interview which purportedly took place between a certain Ms Carlamaria Rumor said to be a staff member of RAI Television in Italy and Adoke in November 2015.

The DSS said a joint team of security operatives had raided Igboho’s residence early on Thursday based on an intelligence report. Parading the suspects at the national headquarters of the secret police its spokesman Peter Afunaya said the security team was engaged in a gun duel by nine men suspected to be Igboho’s guards. Afunaya stated “A team of joint security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeyemo at Soka in Ibadan. This was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place. “On approach to his residence the team came under heavy gun attack by nine men suspected to be Igboho’s guards. Six were armed with AK-47 guns and three others with pump action rifles. “In the course of the exchange two of the armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants in his right hand sustained injury. He has however received medical attention and is very stable. “The gun duel which lasted an hour offered Igboho the chance to escape. Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho is now on the run.” Those arrested are: Abdulateef Ofeyagbe; Amoda Babatunde aka Lady ‘K’ Tajudeen Erinoyen Diakola Ademola Abideen Shittu Jamiu Noah Ayobami Donald Adelabe Usman Oluwapelumi Kunle Raji Kazeem Taiwo Opeyemi and Bamidele Sunday. Afunaya added that the team searched the house and subsequently recovered seven AK-47 assault rifles three pump action guns 30 fully charged AK-47 magazines 5000 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition five cutlasses one Jack knife one pen knife two pistol holsters a pair of binoculars a wallet containing $5 local and international driving licences in his name ATM cards a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name; two whistles 50 cartridges and 18 walkie-talkies. Others are three charm jackets\/traditional body armour two laptops one Toshiba and one Compaq laptops and his passport and those of many others. Afunaya added that five of the AK-47 assault rifles recovered from his residence were snatched from Nigeria Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko Ogun State. Afunaya explained that Igboho and his group in the guise of campaign for self-determination had become well-armed and determined to undermine public order. He added the arrests and seizures were a confirmation of a grand plan by Igboho and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian state. Some of his aides had said the invasion which they alleged claimed the lives of five occupants of the house was carried out by soldiers and operatives of the Department of State Services. The Nigerian Army however said it had no hand in the attack. One of our correspondents who visited Igboho’s house observed blood stain on the floor in front of the main building. Windows of some vehicles and buildings on the premises were shattered. There was thick blood clot in one of the chalets an indication that someone might have been killed or badly injured and one of Igboho’s aides said the victim who he identified simply as Alfa was praying inside the building when he was shot in the head and died on the spot. A resident of the building said although government agencies had been monitoring Igboho’s movements before now the attack might not be unconnected to the Yoruba Nation rally scheduled to hold in Lagos on Saturday. The Convener of the Igangan Development Advocates Mr Oladiran Oladokun who visited the scene of the attack told one of our correspondents that the invasion of Igboho’s residence was an attack on the entire Yoruba people. One of Igboho’s aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said “Chief surprised every one of us because the attackers were everywhere but he escaped. The assailants came around 1.30am scaled the fence and opened fire. “I think the instruction they were given was to kill every living thing sighted on the premises.  A lady was the one directing them.  She was calling occupants of the house by their names.  That is to show that an insider gave them the information they relied on. “They took away about N3m from his (Igboho’s) room as well as his jewellery.” Another occupant of the house who also spoke on condition of anonymity said “The assailants killed five persons and took away their corpses. Some ladies who are wives of chief’s aides were also taken away. They took away the CCTV box so that we won’t play bac Meanwhile the Yoruba Council of Elders and Afenifere leader Chief Ayo Adebanjo  slammed the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for the attack on the home of the Yoruba Nation agitator. The YCE expressed concern about the invasion of Igboho’s home. The Secretary-General of the YCE Dr Kunle Olajide who spoke with one of our correspondents in Ibadan said the group was concerned about the incident. He urged the Federal Government to investigate the attack and bring those behind it to justice very quickly. Olajide stated “It is unimaginable that Sunday Igboho’s home was so viciously attacked. Sunday Igboho is not violating any law of the land. There is freedom of movement and freedom of association in a democracy. “The Yoruba Council of Elders is very disturbed by this. Much as we are not backing any secessionist and self-determination agenda for now because we believe this country can still be salvaged but reactions from authorities continue to show us that the government is insensitive to what the people are saying.” On his part Adebanjo said from all indications the assault on Igboho’s home was sponsored by the government and described it as an attack on the Yoruba. The 93-year-old stated “It is a government sponsored attack from all indications. It is unfortunate particularly for the Yoruba. “Mr President has taken us back to the Abacha regime. It was the same they did to Alfred Rewane Gen Alani Akinrinade Chief Abraham Adesanya and many others including members of NADECO. I have said before that this government is a tyrannical government.” When asked if Igboho did not deserve to be arrested due to his opposition to Fulani herders Adebanjo said if that was the reason why he was being attacked then it showed that the government was partial. Meanwhile the Lagos State Police Command has said it will not allow any rally in the state under any guise. The state Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu warned organisers of the planned Yoruba Nation rally and their followers to stay off the streets of Lagos adding that anyone caught would be dealt with according to the law. Odumosu said intelligence reports available to the police indicated that some people had perfected plans to infiltrate the protesters and cause more mayhem in the state. “Lagos State cannot afford to experience any security lapse breakdown of law and order and threat to public peace at the moment considering the negative effects and reoccurring agonies of the October 2020 violent #EndSARS crisis that led to massive destruction of public and private facilities while some police personnel paid the supreme price” he said. Meanwhile Igboho has suspended the Yoruba Nation rally scheduled to hold in Lagos on Saturday. Igboho who spoke to the BBC News Pidgin stated that the rally had been suspended. His words come after a statement by the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups Ilana Omo Oodua declared that the rally would hold as scheduled. The statement was signed by its leader Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye and made available to journalists by his Communications Manager Mr Maxwell Adeleye. “We want to confirm again that the Pro-Yoruba Nation rally scheduled to hold on Saturday July 3 in Lagos will proceed as scheduled” the statement read in part.

Mamora said this at a virtual conference on ‘Nigeria and the next pandemic: Preparedness response and vaccines’ organised by The Conversation Africa. The minister said “The NCDC will have access to 2.5 per cent of the five per cent of the funds earmarked for health emergencies. “We were not as prepared as we would have loved to at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic but the resources we had were based on previous investment in health security by the NCDC. “We are seeking this opportunity this moment of disruption to build more sustainable and resilient systems for health security in Nigeria.” Mamora said although it was difficult to prepare for future pandemics while still in the midst of one the World Health Organisation estimate which states that the world faces a threat of pandemic every five years was enough reason to prepare. He said vaccine manufacturing was one of the key areas of preparing for future pandemics adding that the country had leveraged on COVID-19 to strengthen its health facilities. Mamora added that Nigeria had learnt a lot of lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and it would prepare the country for future pandemics. The minister stated that Nigeria was focusing on vaccine development to cater for the shortage of vaccines in the country. He said “Bio-Vaccine Nigeria Limited a joint venture between the Nigerian government and a private firm is working on manufacturing vaccines for the country. “We have every need to do that in light of what is happening in the global stage. Right now a lot of countries in Africa and even Nigeria can’t have access to vaccines. “We can only hope to get over that or we have our own manufacturing hub in Nigeria and that is what we are working towards achieving. “As many are aware the world is facing inequitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines with Africa bearing the brunt of it. While countries in Europe and America are fully vaccinated with as high as 50 per cent of their population in less than one year African countries are still around one per cent and faced with a scarcity of vaccines.” Mamora noted that the pandemic had created a sense of urgency around vaccine development and manufacturing in the African region. “In Nigeria we have taken this opportunity to fully establish our capacity for vaccine manufacturing. We have been working closely with Bio-Vaccines Nigeria Limited” he added. Earlier the Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency Faisal Shuaib said Nigeria would get 3.92 million doses of Oxford\/Astrazeneca vaccines this month or in August.

The trial judge Justice Gideon Kurada adjourned the case following submissions of both the prosecuting and defence counsel during the resumed hearing. Counsel for the embattled Shi’ite leader Femi Falana SAN told journalists shortly after the court proceedings that he prayed the court to rule in favour of El-Zakzaky and his wife. Falana said both the prosecuting and defence teams addressed the court on the no case submission. According to him though the prosecuting counsel has called 15 witnesses so far “we felt that no case has been established to warrant our clients being in court.” “We addressed the court that there is nothing to defend. The court took our addresses and adjourned to July 28 for ruling on the no case submission” Falana added. But the prayer was opposed by the prosecuting counsel Dari Bayero who is also the state Director of Public Prosecutions insisting that the defendants had a case to answer and asked the court to overrule the no case submission. Bayero had on March 31 2021 prayed that the court to sentence El-Zakzaky and Zeenat as provided by the law of the land. The trial of El-Zakzay and Zeenat began on November 18 2020. Copyright PUNCH.

The House urged Baba to “clarify the policy with specific regard to factory-fitted tinted glasses” while mandating the Committee on Police Affairs to “invite the Inspector General of Police to clarify the issues relating to his directives (in order) to stop the extortion threat and harassment of Nigerian road users by men of the Nigeria Police Force.” The resolution was sequel to a motion unanimously adopted at the plenary on Thursday which was moved by Henry Nwawuba and titled ‘Need to exercise caution in the implementation of the Police directives on vehicles with tinted glasses.’ Nwawuba  said “The House is aware that the overzealousness of some police officers has led them to harass and embarrass citizens with dully authorised tinted glass permits which are currently in use. “The suspension which is a temporary measure will remain in force pending the release of a new protocol that would regulate the issuance of tinted glass permits for vehicle owners and operators in the country.  “The House is disturbed by the outcry of citizens over the undue harassment and intimidation by members of the Nigeria Police even when they are in possession of authorisation by the same Nigeria Police Force.” Copyright PUNCH.

Osinbajo said this on Thursday in his address at the maiden edition of the strategic engagement on sustainable mining titled: ‘Resurrecting our Buried Prosperity’. The Senior Special Assistant to the Vice-President on Media and Publicity Laolu Akande disclosed this in a statement titled: ‘Govts Communities Collaboration will be a Game-changer for Nigeria’s Mining Sector’. The Vice-President said “Some state governments in a bid to shore up their revenues impose illegal fees taxes and levies on foreign and local licensed mining companies and operators. “Enforcement of these taxes often leads to the frequent arrests and harassment of licensed miners and their workers and closures of mining sites. This happens frequently. “Regrettably such actions by state governments constitute a major disincentive to prospective investors in the sector and invariably jeopardise the efforts of the government to deepen the mining industry in Nigeria. “There is no way this will ever benefit the majority of our people.” He also lamented the spate of insecurity in resource-rich communities as rival groups struggle to control access. Osinbajo stated “Then there are the huge security concerns that always develop in the struggle for the control of mineral resources in poorly regulated unregulated or ungoverned spaces. “Almost invariably these situations lead to criminal activities and particularly the proliferation of weapons and armed groups. This is true historically and more evident now.” This he said necessitated the strategic cooperation between the Federal Government states and resource-rich communities. “It is for these reasons that this strategic engagement with the leadership of the 774 local governments is critical” he noted.

Joined as a co-defendant in the suit is Alhaji Nasir Illyasu. He is to be installed as the new Serikin Hausawa of Jebba on Friday (today). In a suit filed before Justice E. B. Mohammad and argued on Thursday the traditional ruler challenged the emir over the planned installation. The counsel for the plaintiffs Adekunle Bamidele said that Yusuf Gwadabe was the recognised Serikin Hausawa of Jebba having been installed since 2017 with a letter of recognition acknowledging him as the authentic titleholder by one Kinrinjin Adebara for the then chairman of the Moro LGA. Bamidele prayed the court “to restrain Alhaji Sulu-Gambari the Emir of Ilorin from turbaning the first defendant Nasir Iliyasu as the Serikin Hausawa of Jebba in Ilorin the state capital on July 2 2021.” Justice Mohammad who admitted that the Jebba’s monarch has the sole authority to install lesser chiefs in his domain declined to grant the injunction.

{"id":"732","headline":"AstraZeneca: Nigeria faults EU’s rejection says decision political","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/astrazeneca-nigeria-faults-eus-rejection-says-decision-political","stories":"The African Union the Federal Government and COVAX a coalition consisting of the World Health Organisation  Gavi and Epidemic Preparedness Innovations on Thursday expressed surprise about the European Union’s decision not to accept AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India. The Director of the African Centre for Disease Control Dr John Nkengasong  and the African Union Special Envoy on COVID-19 Mr Strive Masliywa who stated this during a virtual press briefing with some journalists urged the EU to review the decision. Also on Thursday COVAX  consisting of  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations the WHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund lamented that the EU’s move was already undermining confidence in life-saving vaccines that were safe and effective. On its part the Federal Government described the EU’s decision as political. Recall that the EU said that only those with the EU Digital COVID-19 certificate which enabled people who had received two doses of a vaccine approved by its medicine regulator the European Medicines Agency would be able to travel freely within the bloc. But the pass only recognises AstraZeneca doses (branded Vaxzevria) made by EMA-approved manufacturers in Europe United States South Korea and China not those manufactured by the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer the Serum Institute of India branded Covishield. COVAX a coalition whose aim is to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries donated to African countries AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India. But Thursday  Nkengasong said the EU decision was shocking. He stated “It came as a big surprise. The AstraZeneca vaccine that came from India was funded by COVAX supplied by COVAX and COVAX was funded mainly by the Europeans until recently when the Americans joined; so that came as a big surprise to us that the vaccine which was being supported by the Europeans and supported by WHO and COVAX will not be recognised by the green digital certificate in Europe. “We have always said since the start of this pandemic that we should use science and data to take decisions and I don’t think this one  was driven by science. “If the vaccines were producing less quality antibodies we would argue it but the antibodies produced are of good quality.” Masliywa agreed with Nkengasong saying “In Europe there are vaccine manufacturing plants when we approached them when the pandemic started we were told they could not spare any and we were referred to India. “The Europeans themselves financed COVAX the vaccines purchased from COVAX were purchased by their money. Now we are calling on them to open up their facilities to sell their own vaccines to us. We are not asking for donations now we have the money. Even the poorest of the African countries have raised money to finance the vaccine acquisition.” He added that the US would  begin shipping the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines it had donated to Africa from this weekend. On its part COVAX in a statement on Thursday said the coalition  was built on the principle of equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines to protect the health of people all across the globe. It stated “As travel and other possibilities begin to open up in some parts of the world COVAX urges all regional national and local government authorities to recognise as fully vaccinated all people who have received COVID-19 vaccines that have been deemed safe and effective by the World Health Organization and\/or the 11 Stringent Regulatory Authorities  approved for COVID-19 vaccines when making decisions on who is able to travel or attend events. “Any measure that only allows people protected by a subset of WHO-approved vaccines to benefit from the re-opening of travel into and with that region would effectively create a two-tier system further widening the global vaccine divide and exacerbating the inequities we have already seen in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. “It would negatively impact the growth of economies that are already suffering the most. Such moves are already undermining confidence in life-saving vaccines that have already been shown to be safe and effective affecting uptake of vaccines and potentially putting billions of people at risk. At a time when the world is trying to resume trade commerce and travel this is counter-effective both in spirit and outcome.” The Federal Government described the EU’s decision on the digital COVID-19 certificate as political. The Secretary of the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 Dr Mukhtar Muhammed said this in an interview with The PUNCH. He said the decision lacked scientific facts. Muhammed said “I think people have to make a distinction between a scientific decision and also a political decision and from a scientific decision there is no difference between a vaccine that is got from COVAX and a vaccine produced in Europe “The vaccines are the same. The manufacturing processes are the same the storage and packaging are actually the same. “We know also that there are political decisions which the European Union has made several mistakes since the commencement of this pandemic they had Oxford AstraZeneca they didn’t release it but were vaccinating their people. “These are all political decisions that they have made “And in this particular instance  I want to believe that they are not disputing the efficiency of the Covishield but rather it is just a political decision to say that particular manufacturer has not been approved in Europe and that is not something that should be in the news “They could have just told the manufacturers to make sure that they register their products in Europe. “It is really unfortunate that we are making politics out of science. It is sad as we are going through a lot with this pandemic.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The road is the busiest in the state as it links Sokoto Kebbi and Zamfara states to other parts of the country including Kano Kaduna Abuja Lagos and Port Harcourt. The villagers who were mostly women and children blocked the road near Tashar Abu in the Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State and prevented motorists from passing through. Residents of Bingi village in the Maru Local Government Area of the state had last week similarly staged a demonstration on the same road. Our correspondent who was at the scene of Thursday’s protest reported very long queues of vehicles stranded on the road. Security personnel sent to secure the road could not disperse the angry protesters until some bandits who were carrying guns and riding on motorcycles approached the place. The security agents as well as the protesters and motorists hurriedly dispersed and ran in different directions.

Ogban who was the collation\/returning officer during the National Assembly election was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment by the Akwa Ibom High Court 2 sitting in the Ikot Ekpene Local Government Area of the state. He was found guilty of manipulating and falsifying the result in the Oruk Anam and Etim Ekpo local government areas in favour of the All Progressives Congress. His application for bail was filed on June 17 2021 through his counsel led by Kanu Agabi (SAN) and supported by a 16-paragraph affidavit. At the hearing of the bail application on Thursday before the Akwa Ibom State High Court presided over by Justice Pius Idiong counsel to the applicant said his client’s application for bail on health grounds was pending at the appellate court as stated in paragraphs 9 10 and 11 of the affidavit and urged the court to use it discretion to grant bail to the professor adding that Ogban did not have any criminal record before his conviction in March. But the counsel for the Independent National Electoral Commission Clement Onwuenwunor opposed the application and filled a 21-paragraph counter-affidavit. Onwuenwunor said before such an application could be granted the applicant must first demonstrate exceptional circumstances or unusual reasons before the court could exercise discretion in his favour. Justice Idiong thanked the lawyers for their submissions and adjourned the case till July 12 2021 for ruling. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The lawmakers voted out a prayer asking the government to lift the ban while considering the report by the joint committee mandated by the House to investigate the matter. The report had divided the lawmakers with some members of the House criticising the report for failing to address the main issues. The Committees on Information National Orientation Ethics and Values; Telecommunications; Information and Technology; Justice; and National Security and Intelligence had laid its report on the investigation on Wednesday. At the plenary on Thursday the joint committee was silent on whether the ban should be lifted or not. It recommended “that time be allowed for the Federal Government of Nigeria and Twitter to enter into the dialogue process that is already ongoing to create room for amicable settlement on the matter.” It added “That relevant government Institutions such as National Broadcasting Commission Nigeria Communication Satellite etc should be alive to their mandate by doing the needful to avoid future occurrence of this nature. “The Federal Government should take into cognisance the negative effect of the Twitter suspension on Nigerians who depends on the platform for their livelihood. “The freedom of expression is not absolute anywhere in the world. This is because security and freedom of expression sometimes present contending interests. Therefore national security must be guaranteed at all times as much as the right to free speech must be protected.” While Chairman of the joint committee Olusegun Odebunmi was presenting the report the Deputy Speaker Ahmed Wase who presided over the Committee of the Whole for consideration of the report interjected him saying “I’m sorry I will beg that we step down this report.” Wase added that no member of the committee signed the report.” Odebunmi however said the original copy signed by members was not the one copied to members. The Deputy Speaker was then provided a copy of the signed version but he asked if the panel engaged the National Security Adviser Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno (retd.) on the matter. Odebunmi who did not answer the specific question said all committees were represented during the exercise. Not sacrificed the Deputy Speaker noted that the committee did not explore all the avenues before we come back to the floor. The Deputy Minority Leader Toby Okechukwu criticised the report noting that there were clear instructions on what the committee should do such as determining the legal authority for the ban and inviting the Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed. Okechukwu said “None of the five recommendations has answered any of the questions.” The Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila who sat on the floor noted that the committee met with Mohammed adding “I think it is uncharitable to try and lampoon the work done by the committee.” Gbajabiamila asked those who were not satisfied with the report to amend the recommendations. Okechukwu prayed the House to amend the second prayer and ask the government to lift the ban. The prayer was rejected. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The foreign police reportedly whisked Garb away last week Thursday  following his resistance against  the alleged encroachment of some parcels of land in Ogun State Nigeria  by authorities of  the Benin Republic . Nigeria and Benin Republic share boundary in some parts of Ogun West. The PUNCH had reported the issue of land encroachment by Benin Republic in Ogun State. Our correspondent gathered that Garb after his arrest had been taken to court and detained in Benin Republic. Residents said he was neither allowed to have a legal representation during the proceeding. The lawmaker representing Yewa-North state constituency II Wahab Haruna said “Dr Kunle Garb was arrested on Thursday by Benin Republic police who came into the state. “His arrest has to do with his role  in the case of  encroachment of Nigerian  land  in igbokofi Ogun State  by  Benin Republic . “I consulted community leaders and we visited the police station in Ipobe Republic of Benin to secure his release but I was prevented from seeing him.” He however said that prominent persons in the country including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo  deputy governor of the state Noimot Salako-Oyedele and other top government officials  had been informed about the development .” A resident who was at Benin Republic during the trial of Garb  Afolabi  Amosu said  Benin Republic police  whisked him  away from a  Igbokofi Market. He said “We were not allowed to enter the court room; it was only Dr Kunle Garb and the Benin Republic police that were allowed in the court room. “The Benin Republic police said that he (Garb) was causing commotion in the town. They didn’t allow us to get a lawyer. We asked them if they could get us a lawyer they said it hasn’t got to that level. He was returned to cell again on Monday and he has been there.” Attempts to get Ogun State Government’s reaction failed as the governor’s Chief Press Secretary  Kunle Somorin had yet to reply to a text message sent to him.

{"id":"748","headline":"Firms merge plan 1000 mini-grids","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/firms-merge-plan-1000-mini-grids","stories":"Engie Energy Access Nigeria has announced plans to build 1000 mini-grids across the country in synergy with the Federal Government’s move to power five million rural communities nationwide. The company formed by the merger of Fenix International a player in Nigeria’s pay-as-you-go industry; ENGIE Mobisol a solar home systems company; and ENGIE PowerCorner a mini-grids provider announced the integration at its corporate launch on Tuesday in Lagos. The Managing Director ENGIE Nigeria Bankole Cardoso while responding to questions from journalists said the company maintains a relationship with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to ensure regulatory compliance in its operating states in developing its mini-grid business. He said “A mini-grid is a big investment and is infrastructure because it is there and you can’t move it. We do about six months of grid analysis in the location and we work with NERC for certification and then you educate the community on benefits.” Cardoso revealed that the company was building a 100 kilowatt mini-grid in Banga Niger State that will serve “about 700 households and six small-scale industrial projects.” Commenting on the affordability of ENGIE’s products he noted that “The NERC sets the tariffs and regulates based on the state that you are in. “Our solutions save about 60 per cent from running a generator monthly. Comparing it to the national grid we are expecting our customers in Banga on the smaller scale to pay about N2000 a month and the larger utility industries pay about N20000.” He lamented the challenges the company faced with forex as it imported solar panels and batteries saying “Everyone produces in China as they are the most efficient solar market in the world. “The government does have some policies to encourage people to produce locally such as the five million rural area connections goal by giving grants and financing to companies like ours to scale up business in rural areas. “We already have an agreement with our customers to stabilise prices and we are also using different financing tools to hedge those forex risks.” Copyright PUNCH.

According to a statement on Thursday the hearing on the ‘Bill for a Law to Regulate Organ Harvest and Transplant’ was needed “considering the disturbing trend of illegal trafficking of human organs by unscrupulous elements.” The Speaker of the House Mudashiru Obasa who was represented by the Deputy Speaker Eshinlokun Sanni stated that the bill was important. He said “Organ harvesting is a very important aspect of medical practice in our common bid for healthy existence. Harvested organs are what experts transplant in the treatment of those in medical need of those organs due to failure of their own organs.” Obasa noted that the regulation of organ harvest and transplant will end the unethical and dangerous practices being perpetrated by some nefarious individuals. “This bill seeks to create a system that will annihilate the bad ethics and illegalities being perpetrated by some nefarious elements which call for concerted effort like we are seeking to make today. This bill seeks to introduce a system that will introduce structural sanctity in that aspect of medical profession” he added.

{"id":"751","headline":"Dealing with rising insecurity","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/dealing-with-rising-insecurity","stories":"Currently I think there’s more hope in the future than in the present: Nigerian leaders seem to be paying more attention to the 2023 elections than on the spate of insecurity across the country. We’ve however forgotten that the present ultimately determines the future. Surely when there’s power in the future there ought to be a symbiotic synergy of power in the present that would propel us to acting and living as we want the future to be. Focusing more on the 2023 presidential election in particular and not on the more daunting security challenges is a gross dereliction of duty making many ambassadors of disintegration and disunity. I remember T.S. Eliot talking about “historical sense” in poetry. However in a polity like ours I believe it’s about time we plunged into some deep “political sense” of inspiration for transformation even more seriously where the past influencing the present and the present simultaneously work together for a blissful future. The sweat of the toil the toil of the slavery and the slavery of our heroes past are worth remembering for significant political progress in Nigeria. No politician politicks in a vacuum. It behoves us to assert then that they could not but be metastasised by the power of “the anxiety of influence.” While it’s commendable that local security outfits like Amotekun Shege Ka Fasa and Ebubeagu have been put in place primarily to subdue killings kidnappings and banditry and secondarily to work with constitutionally established armed forces it’s noteworthy to mention particularly that these policing architectures have been institutionally abused that their raison d’être has been misplaced altogether. I don’t know – but maybe because of his military background – the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) nay his regime is loaded with good initiatives and ideas. That’s why the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami could come out openly castigating the Federal Government with respect to the he claimed “illegal” creation of Amotekun. It might be argued that the bottom-line of such rebuttal roughly could be pinned on the nuanced belief that Buhari operates on a rather undemocratic panoply patterned after Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu (or even Naftali Bennett himself!) Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko Russia’s Vladimir Putin and the rest of them. First I feel very strongly that if Shege Ka Fasa had been strengthened in the North Boko Haram or bandits would not have made the business of banditry through the cracked walls which could have been holistically cemented by the complementary efforts of the entire components of a federal system; cracking down on the collapsing walls of the zone notably craving for lives of schoolboys and schoolgirls is actually discomforting. The rescue of the Chibok schoolgirls on April 14 2014 looks to have been replicated in the overnight Kankara schoolboys’ return on December 15 2020 indeed absolutely appalling to social activists and crusaders. A former minister Oby Ezekwesili in particular believes that the Kankara episode was a presidential magical act borne out of the Buhari regime’s desperation to gain some credibility. Secondly and far more importantly the South-West’s Amotekun well-resourced would have definitely played a crucial in easing the tension between the police and #EndSARS protesters last year. Leadership in turbulent times requires a high level of team management which is what democracy has afforded. One of the reasons why any significant progress has not been made with respect to insecurity in the country is the ambition of the Presidency for 2023. In the meantime I suspect we are losing more lives to insecurity. All the jabs necessary to combat the growing insecurity motivating calls for secession should as it were be imported as quickly as possible.

He said “The aim of the programme is to help schools build a community in which their students teachers and even parents can become pragmatic problem solvers. Becoming a ‘Thinking School’ comes with lots of advantages. The modules of the training focus on teaching staff how they can become better thinkers; they also learn how they can teach students to think critically creatively and objectively to solve both academic and life problems. “Aside from that the Thinking School programme helps improve students’ academic performance and reduces behavioural problems. The reason for this is that the programme teaches students to think about the consequences of their actions and inactions thereby making them be responsible for the outcomes. “It takes 18 months to become certified and within that period.” Copyright PUNCH.

He said there was the need to harness the available unconventional feed resources localised in different eco-systems and regions in Nigeria. He said the utilisation of some important unconventional feedstuffs through improved feeding regimes and the management practices could be used to improve the productivity of animals which would stimulate human productivity engender development and increase gross domestic product. “By doing so Nigeria will join the league of advanced countries in the world in no distant future” Bamgbose said.

{"id":"791","headline":"We’re seeking explanation from FG on Kanu’s arrest says Britain","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/were-seeking-explanation-from-fg-on-kanus-arrest-says-britain","stories":"THE United Kingdom has said it will seek clarification from the Federal Government on the circumstances and legality of the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra. The Head of Communications British High Commission Mr Dean Hurlock who stated this while responding to enquiries from one of our correspondents said the UK was in the process of seeking explanations from the Federal Government on the circumstances surrounding Kanu’s arrest and extradition. Hurlock said this as Ifeanyi Ejiofor  the lead counsel to the detained IPOB leader said members of the legal team had formally applied to the Department of State Service to allow them access to their client. Recall that Kanu who is facing trial for treasonable felony jumped bail in 2017 and fled the country for the UK when soldiers stormed his parents’ residence at Afaraukwu Abia State. On Tuesday he was re-arraigned before Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court Abuja  two days after he was arrested and extradited  to the country. He is still being remanded in the custody of the Department of State Services by the Federal High Court. The UK which had on Tuesday said Kanu who is also a British citizen was not arrested within its territory  made further  clarifications on Wednesday. Responding to enquiries from one of our correspondents on the legality of Kanu’s arrest and extradition the Head of Communications British High Commission Hurlock on Wednesday reiterated that the IPOB leader was not arrested or extradited from the UK. Hurlock said “In response to any queries on whether Nnamdi Kanu was extradited from the UK we can reaffirm that Nnamdi Kanu was not arrested in the UK nor was he extradited from the UK. “With regards to any questions about the possible legality of his arrest the British High Commission in Abuja is currently in the process of seeking clarification from the Nigerian government about the circumstances of the arrest.” The British Government also said its Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office was ready to provide consular assistance to Kanu who was expected back in court on July 26. Hurlock further said the UK expected the trial of the Biafran separatist to follow due process. He noted “With regard to any questions about whether the British High Commission is providing assistance in this case we can confirm that the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office stands ready to provide consular assistance. “With regard to any questions about what the UK thinks about the proposed legal process that Nnamdi Kanu is facing in Nigeria the UK would expect any trial or legal proceedings to follow due process.” Meanwhile the IPOB spokesperson Emma Powerful disclosed that Kanu was arrested in Kenya by security operatives. Powerful in a statement quoted Kanu’s brother Kingsley as stating that the IPOB leader was detained while visiting Kenya and handed over to the FG. According to IPOB spokesman Kanu’s brother  stated  “My brother has been subject to extraordinary rendition by Kenya and Nigeria. They have violated the most basic principles of the rule of law. “Extraordinary rendition is one of the most serious crimes states can commit. Both Nigeria and Kenya must be held to account. I demand justice for my brother Nnamdi Kanu.” Kingsley admonished the British High Commission to insist on his brother’s release adding that the mission must guarantee his safety and security. He stated “The British High Commission in Nigeria must insist upon my brother’s immediate release. They must guarantee his safety and security. “Nnamdi Kanu must be returned home to the UK to his wife and his sons who live here. The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab must make it clear to the Nigerian authorities that they will not tolerate the unlawful detention of British citizens and that the UK government condemns the Nigerians and Kenyans for undermining the rule of law. “Foreign Secretary Raab must be clear: There will be consequences for those who resort to extraordinary rendition. The British Government must insist upon justice for Nnamdi Kanu.” Also IPOB leader younger brother  Kingsley Kanu in a statement on Wednesday said Nnamdi Kanu was arrested in Kenya. He said Nnamdi Kanu’s arrest was unlawful saying he had been subjected to the most and serious violations of international law. Kingsley Kanu said “News has reached Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s family that he has been unlawfully arrested in Kenya.” On his part Kanu’s lawyer said the DSS had yet to respond to the legal team’s application seeking access to the IPOB leader. Ejiofor stated this in a telephone interview with one of our correspondents on Wednesday. He said “We have tried getting access to the office today to see him while he is being detained. “In line with their procedure we have written to the DSS to allow us access to see him more so in view of the subsisting charge. “They have not responded to the application. We were requested to come formally; we have done that and we copied the court. “We are awaiting their response to the application.” Ejiofor also alleged that Kanu was abducted contrary to the popular view that he was arrested. He added “Let me correct an impression. Nnamdi Kanu was not arrested. He was abducted by the Nigerian security agency in collaboration with African allies. “If we are talking about arrest it will sound civil. But in this case he was abducted. “I will confirm from him the exact location where he was abducted from. “He was abducted and smuggled into Nigeria against all professional ethics and in complete violation of all diplomatic conventions. “When we get to the bridge we will cross it as it is a matter for the court to look into.” Also on Wednesday IPOB  warned the Federal Government to be careful with the way it handled its leader saying nothing must happen to him. The secessionist group in a statement by its Director of Media and Publicity  Powerful said Kanu was abducted adding those against the Biafra struggle masterminded the ‘abduction’. It stated “We remind the Nigeria government and her security agencies that our leader deserves justice and fair hearing. We also want to state unequivocally that no harm should befall our leader.  Should anything untoward happen to him Nigeria government will be held accountable for it.” The group urged its members at home and in the Diaspora to remain calm. It added  “Our leader’s next court appearance is July 26 2021 and Biafrans should mobilise and attend the court hearing. “IPOB will not relent in the pursuit of Biafra freedom. We have crossed the Rubicon in our struggle for the restoration of Biafran sovereignty. There is no going back no matter the level of intimidation by our oppressors.” An Igbo group Nzuko Umunna said Kanu should not suffer any  harm. In a statement on Wednesday by its Executive Secretary Joe Odumuko and Deputy Executive Secretary Dr Uju Agomoh Nzuko Umunna demanded fairness in Kanu’s trial warning that he must not suffer any bodily harm in the DSS custody. The group said “We ask the government to ensure that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s fundamental rights are secured to the fullest extent possible. It is noteworthy that Section 31 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights obligate the Federal Government to ensure that Nnamdi Kanu does not suffer any bodily harm while in the custody of the state and its agencies. It bears repeating that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to secure the bodily integrity and personal dignity of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu while in its custody. We shall hold the Nigerian government and all state actors to account on this obligation under domestic and international laws to the fullest extent possible.” On its part the Minority Leader of the Senate Enyinnaya Abaribe  advised the Federal Government to apply caution and strict adherence to the rule of law in  handling  the issue of Kanu. The Senator who stood surety for Kanu when he was first arraigned a few years ago stated this in a statement  by his Media Adviser Uchenna Awom on Wednesday. The statement is titled “Nnamdi Kanu: Abaribe urges respect to fundamental human rights adherence to rule of law.” The Senator also advised the Federal Government to be guided by the provisions of Section 31 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. But a former Director of Public Relations of the Nigerian Army Brigadier General Sani Usman  described arrest  of  Kanu as heart-warming calling for the speedy and diligent discharge of justice. Usman said this on Wednesday morning while speaking on the Sunrise Daily show on Channels Television. A group the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety)  commended the Federal Government for not bringing Kanu ‘body bag’. The rights group in statement signed by Emeka Umeagbalasi and other principal officers Obianuju Igboeli and Chidimma Udegbunam however expressed worries about his safety. However the Archbishop of Enugu Provence Church of Nigeria Anglican Communion Most Rev Emmanuel Chukwuma warned Federal Government to know that if anything should happen to Kanu under custody that there would be greater trouble. He said “If you kill Kanu that would amount to looking for the trouble of the Igbo. “We will not allow him to be eliminated. Let him face his trial and judgment. They cannot eliminate anybody like that. If they eliminate him then they are looking for more trouble.” Also The pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation Afenifere  called on the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari to deploy energy used  in arresting  Kanu to tackle the insecurity in the country. The Secretary General of the association Mr Sola Ebiseni who reacted to the extradition of the IPOB leader  said the arrest of Kanu even in a foreign land  showed how efficient and effective the Nigerian security services and forces could be when operating under the right environment uninfluenced  by political considerations and tribal body languages of the political actors in the illegitimate exercise of the powers granted them by the people. According to the group there is nothing cheering in the arrest against the backdrop of the “dubious approach of the Federal  Government to fighting crimes and criminality in Nigeria. “ Ebiseni said “Nnamdi Kanu is answerable to charges against him and having now been brought before the court the mode of effecting his arrest has become a mere academic exercise. Nonetheless as a citizen of Nigeria he is absolutely entitled to the protection of his fundamental human rights as guaranteed by the constitution and other global norms including the right of presumption of innocence until proven beyond reasonable doubt by the state. “However such level of enormous energy resources and logistics deployed by government to effect the arrest  of  Kanu in whichever locations outside our shores would not have been required  to pick members of the Fulani ethnic militias masquerading as herdsmen whose innumerable criminal activities were at the roots of such violent and incendiary activities that have engulfed the nation since the advent of the Buhari administration and in reaction to which self determination agitations have taken the central stage of our political existence. “Rather than the presidential admonition that victims of mass murder and destruction of economic lives should seek peaceful coexistence  in their own ancestral communities with their invading assailant herdsmen the Federal Government should not only act but be seen to deploy requisite security measures against herdsmen and kidnappers who have held the southern and Middle Belt regions hostage for so long and in recent times emboldened by government duplicity to have also invaded local farmers and indigenous tribes of the North- West. “It leaves a sour taste in the mouth that the Nigerian military and security forces which used to be the toast of international community in peace keeping exercises and the renowned deterrence force in the West African sub region are now subjected to the insult and ridicule of negotiations with bandits who bear arms in their presence and their negotiator agents given field days on television.” Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"792","headline":"NBA faults planned Land Use Act review SANs say move suspicious","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/nba-faults-planned-land-use-act-review-sans-say-move-suspicious","stories":"The Nigerian Bar Association some Senior  Advocates of Nigeria and the Oyo State Governor Mr Seyi Makinde have cautioned the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) against the move to amend the Land Use Act. While the NBA and senior lawyers including Ifedayo Adedipe Yusuf Ali and Tayo Oyetibo said the Federal Government’s move was unconstitutional  Makinde stated that he would not support it. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation Boss Mustapha had on Thursday said the Federal Government was reviewing the Land Use Act of 1978. Mustapha who was represented by a permanent secretary in the Office of the SGF at the  51st annual conference of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers in Abuja said the review would take out sections of the Act that inhibited economic development.  But Makinde said the Land Use Act of 1978 vested the control of land in each state in the governor. He said he did not envisage anybody to take any step that would be contrary to this. The governor who said this on Wednesday through his Chief Press Secretary Taiwo Adisa  while responding to an  inquiry by one of our correspondents  said he would not support any step taken outside the constitution concerning the issue of land. He said “Governor Makinde is a believer in the constitution of the land. He will not support anything that is outside the stipulations of the constitution.  “As much as we know the Land Use Act is a constitutional matter and the states must be involved in anything that has to do with its review. “The act has vested the lands in the governor of the state and we don’t envisage anyone taking contrary steps.” Land is our inheritance in S’East we won’t support what hurts our people—Umahi Also the  Ebonyi Government State said it would oppose the Federal Government’s move to review the Land Use Act if other states in the country faulted  it. The Ebonyi State Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources Chief Ogodo Ali stated this in Abakaliki on Tuesday in a telephone interview with one of  our correspondents. The commissioner “I am a man under command and whatever my governor says is what I stand for. But I know that the Land Use Act cannot be reviewed just like that. And to review the Act it has to go through a lot of processes. “I am of the opinion that once the state governments begin to kick against this kind of move from the Federal Government I know my own governor.  He  will  oppose it. “I heard him (my governor) speak today that in the South-East what our forefathers left for us is land. Some people bequeath gold and silver; but a few others like in the South-East bequeath land. “And I know that my governor loves his people and he wouldn’t like anything to hurt his people and that was why he opposed Ruga. So we have to toe the path where our people must be protected without attacking any arm of the government.” The Assistant Publicity Secretary of the NBA Ferdinand Naza while speaking to one of our correspondents on the intended review of the Land Use Act said “In Nigeria there are procedures which have been laid down for the amendment of a law such the Land Use Act in this case. According to the Nigerian constitution only the National Assembly can review or amend the Land Use Act. “If there is any proposed review to the Act my advice to the President is that it should first be submitted to the floor of the National Assembly for debate.” Senior lawyers in separate interviews with The PUNCH on Wednesday warned the President and the Federal Government saying they could not singlehandedly review the Land Use Act Ifedayo Adedipe (SAN) told one of our correspondents that “ As a Nigerian citizen I really worry about the obsession of our President over this grazing issue. “First of all the National and State Houses of Assembly have to be involved before any amendment or review can take place. Nevertheless I view with suspicion the attempt by the President to review the Land Use Act considering his stance on this grazing issue. “At this point it is important to state that people engaging in animal husbandry do so for their own personal benefits. Grazing is simply one of many private businesses run by individuals not the government. It is really unfortunate that the President has chosen to obsess over this issue.” Yusuf Ali (SAN) said “The Land Use Act is part of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the constitution expressly states the method by which the Act can be reviewed. It is clear that the President cannot singlehandedly review a law; he has to first propose a review or amendment to the National Assembly before anything can be done. “I am eager to see the changes the President wants to effect in the Land Use Act so I can ascertain the true purpose of this intended review.” Tayo Oyetibo (SAN) stated “The Land Use Act has been integrated into the constitution so the procedure for amending the Act invariably involves the National Assembly. Although the President can initiate this process it has to first pass through the National Assembly; there is no other way. “What matters the most is that the constitutional provisions for the amendment of an Act must be complied with.” Copyright PUNCH.

The House therefore mandated its Committee on Army to “investigate the disbursement of non-regular allowances to Army personnel from 2017 till date and report back to the House within four weeks.” A member Abubakar Nalaraba had moved a motion that was unanimously adopted at the plenary on Wednesday titled ‘Need to investigate the non-payment and under utilisation of non-regular allowances of Nigerian Army personnel despite increment in budgetary provision for these Allowances in 2020 and 2021’. The lawmaker also noted that the allowance which includes payments such as first 28 days allowance operations allowance and duty tour allowance of soldiers and officers was necessitated to mitigate the effects of current economic realities on the welfare of troops and entire personnel of the Nigerian Army. He stressed that the increment was captured in the Manual of Finance Administration and approved for implementation by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) on January 26 2018. Nalaraba said “The House is concerned that despite the increment in budgetary provision for non-regular allowances from N283bn in 2020 to about N380bn in 2021 the Army personnel have not felt the corresponding effect and personnel of Nigerian Army involved in internal security operations training and performance of other military duties are still being owed various types of non-regular allowances.” Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"794","headline":"Youth unemployment a time bomb in North – ACF","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/youth-unemployment-a-time-bomb-in-north-acf","stories":"A socio-political organisation Arewa Consultative Forum has expressed concern over the increasing wave of insecurity across northern states. It also said thet youth unemployment in the region was a time bomb. Rising from a meeting of its board of trustees in Kaduna on Wednesday the ACF noted that despite the efforts of the Federal Government Boko Haram bandits kidnappers clashes between herders and farmers had been on the increase. In a communiqué signed by Shehu Malami at the end of the meeting and made available to newsmen by the National Publicity Secretary of the group Emmanuel Yawe said  the ACF also decried a situation where the north was left without a single financial institution to advance the economic growth and fortunes of the region. The statement added “Similarly the board decried the lack of media houses in the north to keep the citizens of the north well informed. “The board observed that without a sound financial foundation and backing the north will always remain backward. “On the problems of unemployment in the north the board said it is regrettable that the north has not realised it is sitting on a time bomb which can explode at any time. “The board resolved that there is the need to take immediate action to salvage the youth from lethargy drugs and substance abuse despondency and banditry.” On the trial of the self-declared leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu the forum hailed the Federal Government security agencies and all those behind the arrest and repatriation.

{"id":"795","headline":"Eight journalists killed 300 violations recorded under Buhari – Report","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/eight-journalists-killed-300-violations-recorded-under-buhari-report","stories":"A 2021 Press Freedom Report released on Wednesday said eight Nigerian journalists had been killed during the regime of the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) It added that apart from the unresolved killings the regime recorded 300 violations affecting about 500 journalists media workers and media houses in the country. The report released by the Media Foundation for West Africa in collaboration with the Nigeria Union of Journalists said the development was of major concern to the NUJ as journalists and media organisations remained targets of attack by both protesters and government. Presenting the report in Abuja the Executive Director Citizen Advocacy for Social and Economic Right Frank Tietie said such actions would bring back unpleasant memories of the long tenure of military rule and the established culture of intolerance against the media. The report said Nigeria was witnessing actions that sought to undermine the profession by both state and non-state actors. According to the report Nigeria was fast gaining notoriety for its failure to tackle impunity for crimes against journalists including killings. The report reads in part “For example in 2017 four journalists were killed in separate incidents with no credible inquiry yet to find the culprits and their motive for the fatal attacks. The four were a cameraman with the Anambra Broadcasting Services Ikechukwu Onubogu; Lawrence Okojie of the Nigeria Television Authority in Edo State a Desk Editor with Glory FM in Bayelsa State Famous Giobaro and freelance broadcaster in Ekiti State Abdul Ganiyu Lawal. “Four more journalists have since been killed under circumstances that have yet to be clarified through any credible investigations. The killing on July 22 2019 of Precious Owolabi a reporter with the Channels Television in Abuja while covering a protest by members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria-IMN was agonising.” The report also said clamping down on the media was a sign of weak democracy and a restive government. Speaking earlier the President of NUJ Chris Isiguzo said the safety of journalists should “include the absence of arbitrary arrest resorting to exile to escape repression harassment destruction and confiscation of equipment and premises and self-censorship in media.” Copyright PUNCH.

A source who declined to have his name mentioned told The PUNCH on Wednesday that three policemen attached to his convoy suffered varying degrees of injury during the attack. In addition the source disclosed that Ganduje was in Jigawa State governor’s car Muhammad Badaru during the attack said the source. According to the source the security operatives in the Governor’s convoy engaged the suspected bandits in a gun duel during which three policemen sustained bullet wounds. Earlier it was reported that suspected bandits killed a lawmaker representing Shinkafi Constituency in the Zamfara House of Assembly Muhammad Ahmad on Tuesday night. It was learnt that Ahmad was killed on his way to Kano by gunmen who also kidnapped the lawmaker’s son and driver just as the bandits were said to have laid siege on Zamfara Katsina and Kano Road near Shema on Tuesday. Recall that this is not the first time such incident would occur as Ganduje’s convoy was attacked in October 2017 by armed robbers at Hayin Kibau en-route Jos the Plateau State capital from Abuja. Similarly it was gathered that Ganduje’s wife Prof. Hafsat Ganduje was in the convoy during the attack which resulted in a heavy gun battle between the security operatives in the convoy and the bandits. It was learnt that the governor and his wife were flown to Abuja in a chopper from Jos after the gun duel. Ganduje was among other APC governors who were in Zamfara on Tuesday to receive Governor Bello Matawalle who defected to the party from the PDP. Meanwhile efforts made to contact Ganduje’s Chief Press Secretary Abba Anwar to confirm the incident was unsuccessful. Nobody is safe says ACF Reacting to the incident the pan-northern socio-political organization Arewa Consultative Forum has described as “sad” development the attack on the convoy of the governor which was on its way to Kano from Zamfara State. The National Publicity Secretary of the ACF Emmanuel Yawe said “It is sad but it goes to show the terrible state of insecurity we are in. I hope the governor is safe and nobody is dead as a result of the attack. Nobody is safe. May God save us all.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Ibe stated this on Wednesday at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory while being cross-examined by the counsel for Ziplon Concept Jeff Njikeonye SAN. He said “My Lord the fourth defendant wrote to the plaintiff that the state government will accept to pay the fee if he accepts a 40\/60% sharing formula. “The Abia State Government offered N250m to me and the fourth defendant (Ziplon) in the presence of Jeff Njikonye and representatives of the government of Abia State. “In the meeting it was revealed that Ziplon had already been paid the sum of N100m and the issue became of what happens to the N250m offered. “The then Accountant General of Abia State was shocked to learn that I did not know that N100m had been disbursed to Ziplon. “If I recall vividly counsel for the fourth defendant interjected and said the N100m was given to the former governor. “At that point I told him I will not be part of money laundering for any individual or entity because of my career and profession. “I proceeded to write a petition to the EFCC against the Abia State Government and some of its officials. Investigation is ongoing.” He informed the court that he turned down the offer as it was deceitful and in bad fate. Mauritz Walson had sued the Abia State Government because the government failed to pay the agreed 30 per cent of the $151410816.39 that was refunded by the Federal Government to the state government for over-deduction from the state foreign loan portfolio. In the suit marked FCT\/HC\/CV\/2470\/2017 the plaintiff approached the court for an order to compel the Abia State Government to pay Mauritz Walton Nigeria Limited the sum of N12m as its fee in the Paris Club refund. It sued the Abia State Government Accountant General of Abia State a bank and Ziplon Consult as first to fourth defendants respectively for the recovery of the agreed sum from the refund.

The President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) nominated Onochie to represent Delta State on the INEC Board as a National Commissioner. The PDP equally gave notice of its plans to retrieve seats of all its federal legislators who dumped the party. National Chairman of the PDP Uche Secondus members of the party’s National Working Committee as well as other party supporters besieged the main entrance of the National Assembly at about 12:30pm to register their displeasure over Onochie’s nomination. PDP’s position was contained in a letter titled ‘Rejection of the Nomination of Lauretta Onochie as INEC Commissioner’ which was signed by its National Secretary Senator Umaru Tsauri and addressed to the Chairman Senate Committee on INEC. The letter read in part “The NWC of the PDP has learnt of the nomination of Mrs. Lauretta Onochie as a Commissioner in INEC by Mr. President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “The nomination which was read on the floor of the Senate and forwarded to your committee for screening has created a lot of misgivings in the court of public opinion and judgement. “Our Party considers it as important to bring to the attention of your committee the fact that our duty is to let you know that the National Assembly must endeavour to do things right and in accordance with the dictates of the laws of the country. “The Nigeria Constitution 1999 as amended clearly prohibits people like Mrs. Onochie who is very partisan in fact a card-carrying member of a political party to be appointed into INEC as an electoral umpire. “Section 156(i)(a) and third schedule Part 1 Item F Paragraph 14(1) of the Constitution have rightly disqualified her. “We are therefore writing to ask the Chairman to save the Senate President the Senate itself and Mr. President from being ridiculed. “We call on your committee to reject the nomination of Mrs. Onochie because she cannot be neutral or independent as she is factually known to be an unrepentant card-carrying member of the APC with uncountable number of proofs”. The Senate Minority Leader Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe (PDP Abia South) and his counterpart in the House of Representatives Ndudi Elumelu received the party executives and promised to kick against the nomination.

{"id":"807","headline":"National Assembly misses June target for PIB passage","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/national-assembly-misses-june-target-for-pib-passage","stories":"The expectation of the National Assembly to pass the Petroleum Industry Bill before the end of June failed to materialise. The President of the Senate Ahmed Lawan had said early June that the National Assembly expected the bill to be passed before the end of the month. “As I speak our joint committee of both Senate and the House on the PIB are about to conclude writing the report which will be submitted to both chambers of the National Assembly. Our expectation is that we will pass the PIB within this month of June by the grace of God” he said at the 2021 Nigeria International Petroleum Summit in Abuja. The PIB which has been in the works since 2008 when it was first introduced to the legislature has suffered setbacks in the last three legislative tenures. In September last year the PIB 2020 was presented by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to the National Assembly for consideration. The delay in the passage of the bill has been a major drag on the industry over the years significantly limiting its ability to attract investments at a time when many other countries are scrambling to exploit their oil and gas resources. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria had urged the Federal Government to ensure that investors in the oil and gas sector are not forced out of the country due to unfavourable sections in the PIB Speaking at the PENGASSAN Total Exploration and Production Nigeria 6th Triennial Branch Delegates Conference in Abuja which ended on Saturday night the National President PENGASSAN Festus Osifo urged the government to ensure the passage of an investor-oriented and balanced PIB. He said “What we are advocating is that as long as government wants to make more money it should also consider the sector’s investors so as to ensure a balanced system. “This is important in order not to make investors run away to other countries that have crude oil. So it must be a balanced bill that will encourage investors to stay. “We have about 37 billion barrels of crude oil reserves; now if we have investors that put their monies into it they will continuously develop these reserves and our national production will increase.” Osifo explained that if investors were dis-incentivised they would go to neighbouring countries to explore and produce crude oil. “That is why we want a balanced bill. Again we want investors to also make money so that at the end of the day our members will be better off for it because the welfare of our members is paramount.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

At the plenary on Wednesday the House resolved that an ad hoc committee be constituted to investigate complaints on misconduct of real estate developers and create a forum for members of the public to lodge complaints against such fraudulent developers. The committee is also to ‘fully investigate the real estate developers suspected of violating applicable laws and liaise with enforcement agencies with a view to prosecution as this will hopefully put an end to these sharp practices’. Also the committee is to work with relevant stakeholders and ministries departments and agencies towards ‘formulating a law issuing guidelines or other appropriate legislations\/regulations for this trillion-naira sector’. The House said this would enhance monitoring regulation and ensure protection of investors of subscribers from illegal transactions and eliminate unethical real estate practices in the FCT. Furthermore the committee is to liaise with relevant MDAs to revisit the issue of compiling a database on property transactions and newly approved developments. In addition the committee is to ensure that real estate developers are duly licensed before engaging in the practice while it would liaise with the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria National Health Fund and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission towards plugging ﬁnancial crime in the sector.

The red chamber increased the fine for illegal importation and sales of firearms to N1m. The fine was initially N1000 in the extant Act. The Senate passed the bill after it considered the report of its committee on Judiciary Human Rights and Legal Matters. Section 35 of the bill was also amended to increase the fine to N3m or three years’ imprisonment or both for anyone who fails to surrender illegal firearms to the relevant authorities during a proclamation for such. The Chairman of the committee Senator Opeyemi Bamidele said the N1000 fine contained in the extant Act was not punitive enough to deter illegal importation and sales of firearms in Nigeria. He said “Clause 39 of the bill which deals with power to seize and destroy confiscated and illegal firearms was amended to provide for inclusion of other law enforcement agencies besides the police and the military. “This is necessary because the power to confiscate or seize illegal firearms should be all-inclusive and not limited to a particular arm of force or law enforcement agency.” The bill also amended sub-clauses (4) and (5) of clause 39 to allow firearms that are not of military serviceable grades but are serviceable to be deployed for use by the civilian joint task force and other registered vigilantes under the approval and supervision of the office of the national security adviser. The senator said the bill became imperative in view of the proliferation of firearms coupled with the security challenges facing the country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Okebukola said this on Wednesday during the take-off of UTME for blind candidates in Lagos saying the nation would benefit if blind candidates enroll in STEM subjects. He said “We are excited about candidates though few who offer STEM subjects since this is an important slant to equal opportunity. A study has been underway since 2018 to explore ways of encouraging many blind candidates to study STEM subjects recognising the inclement conditions for the study of science by blind candidates at the secondary school and post-secondary school levels. “The nation benefits from STEM so we don’t want to see only engineers that are sighted we want doctors and other professionals among those having challenges with their eyes. The benefit of having blind candidates enrol for STEM subjects is enormous; it will enhance national development and these blind professionals will also serve as role models to those coming behind.” Okebukola said no fewer than 335 blind candidates have enrolled in UTME in 11 centres across the country. “In 2019 of the 390 candidates a total of 175 were given admission. This was unprecedented in the history of admission of such a category of students into the Nigerian higher education system. In 2020 89 of the 351 candidates who sat for UTME were given admission. The encouraging development since 2020 is that many more degree-award awarding institutions are showing keen interest in admitting suitably qualified blind candidates.” Copyright PUNCH.

Our correspondent learnt that hearing on his case comes up on Thursday (today) at a Kaduna High Court. The IMN claimed that “there are up to 55 bullet fragments with excessive lead and cadmium poisoning in his body.” While demanding their immediate and unconditional release the organisation said the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and his regime should be held responsible should anything happen to them. A member of the Academic Forum of IMN Abdullahi Musa expressed these concerns in a statement in Abuja titled “Sheikh El-Zakzaky’s life in danger as his health keeps on deteriorating.” According to him if a government bends the laws to pursue an unjust cause it will simply buttress its position on the rule of law as not having one iota of integrity and truth. The statement reads “Up till now they have been suffering from many injuries in their bodies and resultant multiple life-threatening health challenges. Even so the current health condition of Sheikh El-Zakzaky and his wife is causing considerable distress. It is also a constant source of worry to many a Nigerian citizen. “On February 24 2020 Kaduna High Court affirmed them unfit for trial. So an order was immediately given by Justice Gideon Kurada directing the officials of the central prison in Kaduna to grant them access to their doctors but all to little or no avail. “The health situation of Sheikh El-Zakzaky and his wife does not only require their having access to qualified medical personnel right off but also a medical facility with up-to-date equipment.

{"id":"819","headline":"Nobody can accuse me of corruption – Buhari","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/nobody-can-accuse-me-of-corruption-buhari","stories":"THE President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) has insisted that the current polarisation and inherent injustices in the country are neither fuelled by ethnicity nor religion but Nigerians themselves. Buhari said this while receiving members of the Muhammadu Buhari\/Osinbajo Dynamic Support Group recently at the Presidential Villa Abuja. According to him nobody can accuse him of corruption after serving as a governor minister head of state and currently a second-term President. His Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Femi Adesina made the full text of the President’s address to his guests available to journalists on Wednesday under the headline ‘Forget ethnicity forget religion. We the people are the problem of Nigeria says President Buhari’. The President again narrated his struggles to get justice at the courts after disputed results of presidential elections in 2003 2007 and 2011 concluding that people who ruled against him were of his own ethnic stock and religious persuasion while those who stood up for him were of other faiths and ethnicity. He said “Our problem is not ethnicity or religion it is ourselves. After my third appearance in the Supreme Court I came out to speak to those who were present then. I told them that from 2003 I had spent 30 months in court. “The President of the Court of Appeal the first port of call for representation by presidential candidates then was my classmate in secondary school in Katsina. We spent six years in the same class Justice Umaru Abdullahi. “My legal head was Chief Mike Ahamba a Roman Catholic and an Ibo man. When the President of the court decided that we should present our case my first witness was in the box. “Ahamba insisted that a letter should be sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission to present the register of constituencies in some of the states to prove that what they announced was falsehood. It was documented. “When they gave judgment another Ibo man the late Justice Nsofor asked for the reaction from INEC to the letter sent to them. They just dismissed it. He then decided to write a minority judgment. That was after 27 months in court. “We went to the Supreme Court. Who was Chief Justice of Nigeria? A Hausa-Fulani like me from Zaria. The members of the panel went in for about 30 minutes came back to say they were proceeding on break. They went for three months. When they came back it didn’t take them 15 minutes they dismissed us. “In 2007 who was the CJN? Kutigi. Again a Muslim from the North; after eight months or so he dismissed the case. “Again in 2011 because I was so persistent Musdafa a Fulani man like me from Jigawa neighbour to my state was CJN. He dismissed my case. I’ve taken you round this to prove that our problem is not ethnicity or religion. It is ourselves. “I refused to give up; I had tried to wear Agbada after what happened to me in khaki. Something was done to me because I did something to others. You know it.

Recall that the State Governor Nyesom Wike had sent the bill aimed at ensuring transparency fast track development and accountability in the state to the lawmakers. Debating on the bill titled ‘Rivers State regulation for the prohibition of private consultants\/agents for the assessment and collection of personal income tax 2021’ the lawmakers agreed that the bill would entrench accountability. The House Leader and member representing Obio Akpor Constituency 1 Martin Amaehule said the regulation was in pursuant to Section 75 of the state Board of Internal Revenue Service Law No. 12 2012 and contains seven clauses. “The key thing in this regulation is that the state board of revenue service no longer wants consultants to be part of the job of collecting personal income tax for the state government. “The state revenue board wants to collect personal income tax and channel it properly as the existing law provided” he stated. In his remarks the Speaker Ikunyi Owaji-Ibani described the move as good for democracy and a state “whose leader is passionate about development”. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"824","headline":"Land borders reopening motion divides Reps","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/land-borders-reopening-motion-divides-reps","stories":"The House of Representatives on Wednesday rejected a call for the reopening of Nigeria’s land borders saying the security of the country superseded the economic implications. Some members had earlier moved a motion to decry how closure of the borders had crippled economic activities in the border communities. Titled ‘Urgent Need to Reopen Idiroko Border and Other Land Borders in Nigeria’ the motion was jointly sponsored by lawmakers across regional and political lines namely Messrs Kolawole Lawal Umar Kamba Babatunde Humpe Sada Soli Sarkin Adar Abdullahi Salame Daniel Asuquo Awaji-Inombek Abiante Olajide Olatunbosun Isreal Goli and Michael Etaba. The sponsors had prayed the House to urge the Federal Government to reopen the Idiroko and other land borders to boost economic activities and revenue generation to the nation’s economy. They had also prayed the House to also urge the Federal Government to invest in better border security. Lawal who presented the motion recalled that before closure of the borders the Nigeria-Benin Republic border at Idiroko in the Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State alone generated annual revenue of N6bn. He noted that “while the Seme Illela Maigatari and Mfun borders had since been reopened others have remained closed.” Lawal said “The House is concerned that since the closure of Nigeria’s borders in August 2019 residents of Idiroko in Ogun State have witnessed a massive economic downturn. “The House is also worried that inhabitants of other border communities across the country have had it rough since the border closure and have had to take desperate measures to survive thus exacerbating the insecurity situation of the country. “The House is further worried that if Idiroko and other closed land borders across the country are not urgently reopened the people will further suffer and considering the growing agitation as a result of the closure may resort to aggravated crimes to survive as the country continues to lose huge revenue.” But the Deputy Speaker Ahmed Wase warned against reopening the borders noting that the closure was declared by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for security reasons. Wase said “The closure has reduced trans-border movement of arms and ammunition which has consequently reduced crime rate in the country.” Another member Beni Lar also argued that the closure had helped the country’s agricultural sector. The Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila asked those calling for reopening of the borders to also consider the benefits. He also noted that businesses can only thrive when the country is secure. When Gbajabiamila put the motion to voice vote majority of the lawmakers voted against reopening. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The agency arraigned the suspect before the court on one count. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecutor Abu Ibrahim told the judge that Asekun was arrested during the outward clearance of passengers on a Virgin Atlantic Airlines’ flight from Lagos to Heathrow airport in London without lawful authority to export 1000 grams of cocaine a narcotic drug that was prohibited in the country. Following his plea the suspect’s counsel Olasupo Shasore (SAN) informed the court that a bail application had been filed adding that the NDLEA had filed a reply to the application. Shasore urged the court to admit the defendant to bail on liberal terms on the grounds that the offence for which he was charged was open to bail.

Justice Faji adjourned ruling on the bail application till July 16 and ordered the remand of the defendant in the custody of a correctional centre. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"863","headline":"NYSC threatens sanctions as JAMB alleges fake mobilisation certificate","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/nysc-threatens-sanctions-as-jamb-alleges-fake-mobilisation-certificate","stories":"The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board on Tuesday raised concerns about tertiary institutions awarding fake certificates to persons who did not deserve them. The organisation also accused some of the institutions of conniving with some persons to destroy the education sector. The Registrar\/Chief Executive of JAMB Prof. Ishaq Oloyede stated these at the 2021 Batch B pre-mobilisation workshop organised by the National Youth Service Corps with the theme ‘Sustainable Mobilisation Process: The role of stakeholders’ and attended by representatives of tertiary institutions. At the event the Director-General of the NYSC Brig. Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim said the management would apply sanctions on erring institutions and officials who attempted to compromise the mobilisation process. On his part Oloyede said “There are many ways that corps members and their collaborators take towards corrupting the system. The more you stay long in this system the more shocked you are likely to become. “Many institutions still engage in mobilising or awarding certificates to people who didn’t attend their institutions. You are in a position to know because you run the Interim Joint Matriculation Board and others. How many of these students are actually your students? Go on the streets of Nigeria you will see IJMB coaching. These candidates are not supposed to be attending roadside coaching. They are supposed to be in your institution. “Even yesterday (Monday) I got some information that I became dumbfounded almost losing hope that there is nothing we can do. One gentleman came to me. He said ‘all this authentication that you are doing you are just speaking English. People who are making cool money are making it and they are destroying the education system.’ I asked him to give me an example. And he told me that there is what they call Familiar Name that all you need to do is to walk to a corrupt officer in any of our examination bodies and when you go there you say a familiar name. “If your name is John Bello they will tell them (exam officer) and they will look for a John Bello who has written their examination before and simply give a copy of the certificate to you and you will take it and when you write to that examination body giving that photocopy they will take it and say it is authentic. Whereas it is in the wrong man’s hand. The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory Abuja Alhaji Muhammad Bello represented at the workshop by the Secretary Development Secretariat Dr Kelvin Ogbonna pledged support for the NYSC in its efforts towards preventing unqualified graduates into the mobilisation process.

A statement issued on Tuesday by the Chief Press Secretary to the state governor Onogwu Mohammed said the killing followed an actionable intelligence report which led to professional hunters in Okehi Local Government Area of the state ambushing the kidnappers who came out in Abobo area behind Nigerian Iron Ore Mining Company Itakpe to collect the ransom demanded before the release of their victims. Two of the three kidnappers were killed in the process while one escaped into the bush with gunshot wounds with captives freed in the operation. Speaking the Divisional Police Officer Okehi Local Government Area Ovanja Yakubu said men of the Nigeria Police in his division had been drafted to join professional hunters to fetch out the third kidnapper dead or alive. Reacting to the development the Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary Onogwu Muhammed maintained that his position on criminal elements was public knowledge stating that the state would not accommodate any criminal who wanted to deprive the people of their peace.

{"id":"865","headline":"Kanu’s arrest: ACF demands caution Archbishop alleges woman trapped IPOB leader","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/kanus-arrest-acf-demands-caution-archbishop-alleges-woman-trapped-ipob-leader","stories":"THE arrest of Nnamdi Kanu the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra by the Federal Government has attracted mixed reactions from various groups including the Arewa Consultative Forum who urged the Federal Government to be cautious in handle the IPOB leader’s issue. The reactions came just as the British government said Kanu was not arrested in the United Kingdom or extradited from England. Also the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Tuesday ordered that the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu be remanded in the detention of the Department of State Service. Justice Binta Nyako gave the order while granting the application by the prosecution. The counsel for the prosecution S. M. Labaran applied to the court to remand Kanu in custody. Labaran also applied that the trial of Kanu that was earlier slated for October 20 be brought forward. Kanu who appeared without legal representation told the court that his house was earlier invaded. So he had to go underground. The court ordered that Kanu be remanded in DSS facility and adjourned his matter till July 26 and 27. The court also ordered for accelerated hearing and asked the prosecution to inform Kanu’s lawyer of the proceeding in court. Kanu’s lawyer Maxwell Opara told our correspondent that he did not see his client until he left the court premises. Also present at the court premises was Omoyele Sowore who told our correspondent that he had just come to the court when he heard that Kanu was appearing in court. According to him he stood in solidarity with Kanu as he had been in similar situation. Earlier at a press conference the Attorney-General of the Federation Abubakar Malami had confirmed Kanu’s arrest. Responding to questions from one of our correspondents in Abuja on Tuesday the spokesman British High Commission in Nigeria Dean Hurlock said ‘We are aware of reports that Nnamdi Kanu has been detained in Nigeria by the Federal Government of Nigeria. “We can confirm that Nnamdi Kanu was not arrested in the UK for extradition purposes.” Meanwhile Kanu was apprehended by the International Criminal Police while seeking foreign support for the actualisation of the Republic of Biafra. The PUNCH gathered that Kanu who holds Nigerian and British passports was arrested by security operatives outside his London base on Sunday. He had been declared wanted by the Federal Government since 2017 after he jumped bail following the invasion of his country home in Abia State by soldiers. A source disclosed that Kanu was arrested while leaving Israel for an unknown country but this could not be independently verified on Tuesday. The source stated “The request for the arrest of Kanu was made to the INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon France about two months ago. Kanu could not be arrested at his London base because he is a British citizen and repatriating him to Nigeria may be challenging and the process cumbersome. “So the security agencies waited patiently for him to leave the British soil before moving against him; he was arrested while on transit. There was evidence of his meetings with foreign governments to solicit support for Biafra.” The source also referenced the suspension of Twitter by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) who justified his action by stating that Kanu used his Twitter account with 300000 followers “to instruct his loyalists to kill Nigerian soldiers and police officers”. Another source corroborated that Kanu was nabbed while on transit but said he could not confirm the exact location. “The Nigerian government used conventional diplomatic means to facilitate the arrest of Kanu through the INTERPOL. There are also suggestions that our intelligence agencies played a role in the arrest and extradition process. It was confirmed that Kanu was picked up while on transit but the location cannot be immediately confirmed” the source volunteered. As part of strategies to arrest the separatist group leader the President was said to have met with the French President Emmanuel Macron in May during a summit on the financing of African post-COVID economies convened by the French government where he sought Macron and INTERPOL’s support for the arrest of Kanu. In a related development the pan-northern socio-political organisation Arewa Consultative Forum has cautioned the Federal Government to handle the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu with care. According to the ACF the best way out was for the government to keep strictly to the rule of law in handling the matter. This the ACF said was because the IPOB leader had the support of international arm dealers with the capacity to destroy the country. This was just as the Coalition of Northern Groups said it received the news of the arrest and repatriation of the fugitive rebel Nnamdi Kanu with mixed feelings of apprehension and appreciation. The CNG hailed the Federal Government and security agencies that made the arrest possible “particularly the International Police and authorities of the United Kingdom for honouring their obligations with Nigeria.” Both the National Publicity Secretary of the ACF Emmanuel Yawe and the spokesperson of the CNG Abdul-Azeez Suleiman made the positions of the two northern bodies known in a statement released in Kaduna on Tuesday. “The best way out is to keep strictly to the rule of law. Kanu and his collaborators must be made to understand that Nigeria is not a failed state and the rule of law still exists here” the forum said. The statement added “For now we do not have details of the immediate circumstances leading to his arrest. We do not even know where he was arrested whether in Nigeria or outside. “We however know that the man has no respect for the country called Nigeria and has vowed to destroy the country. Sadly he enjoys collaboration of some Nigerians who for some reasons want the country destroyed. “He also enjoys the support of international arm dealers who know that he has the capacity to cause a war to break out in Africa’s most populous country and biggest economy.” On their part the CNG said it remained apprehensive until the the full course of justice took effect on Kanu. The CNG added “In addition he must now face additional charges of incitement to violence and killings of people of other ethnicities particularly northerners security personnel as a result of his open incitement. “More importantly we don’t see Kanu’s arrest affecting the issue of Biafra. While he faces trial hopefully the CNG is insisting that this is the right time to tackle the Biafran issue once for all. “We stand our ground that a referendum must be held to determine this and all other agitations for self-determination from any part of the country.” Reacting to his arrest Archbishop of Enugu Provence Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) Most Rev Emmanuel Chukwuma welcomed his arrest and described it as good development. The fiery cleric accused IPOB leader of jumping bail adding that he didn’t appreciate Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe and others who secured his bail. He said “Rather when he was abroad he was instigating people to cause confusion. We warned him several times to stop that. It’s not only that; we felt that if you are a leader and you are part of the problem of Nigeria you should come down here so we can discuss with others on how to solve the problem. Chukwuma while describing Kanu as a weak leader alleged that IPOB leader “played into the hands of Nigerian Intelligence Agency who set him up with a woman from London to Brazil where he was arrested and then tranquilised to the point of bringing him to Nigeria. “That shows irresponsibility. How can a woman and tranquiliser be a way of catching you if you are really a very strong leader? I feel disappointed in him because they lured him out of London to Brazil with a woman. It’s a shame.” But the acting leader of the apex socio-political group Afenifere Chief Ayo Adebanjo has faulted the arrest of the leader of the Independent People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu. Adebanjo said the foreign country was not supposed to have handed over Kanu to the Nigerian government while he was enjoying a political asylum. He said this on Tuesday while speaking with newsmen shortly after the meeting held at his Sanya-Ogbo  Ijebu-Ode residence. When asked to react to the arrest and prosecution of Kanu Adebanjo said. “Anybody fighting for revolution must be ready for that; I was also a victim of treasonable felony. They tried some of us; what the British did they did for Action Group when they repatriated Chief (Anthony) Enahoro. “They didn’t do it while we were in Ghana the government there protected us. He (Kanu) had been giving asylum they then sent him back. It is wrong and improper having granted him asylum to hand him over to his enemy I condemn it…” In another development the Indigenous People of Biafra has confirmed the arrest of its leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. This was contained in a statement by IPOB\/Nnamdi Kanu lead counsel Ifeanyi Ejiofor on Tuesday. Ejiofor in the statement demanded that Kanu’s fundamental rights must be respected while in custody. “We have just confirmed through correspondence from the Federal High Court Abuja the arrest and the extradition of my client Mazi Nnamdi Kanu by the Nigerian State. “It is to be noted therefore that no matter the gravity of the offences or charge preferred against him Section 36(5) of the Constitution still presumes him innocent of the allegation. The legal team ably led by my humble self will meet them in court on this date. “We insist that he must be given a fair hearing\/trial which is his constitutionally protected right. His safety as also guaranteed under our law throughout the trial and afterwards should be enforced. “Our fortified legal team will be meeting to agree on strategies within the context of the charge and disposition of the court. Await further updates from us as we progress” part of the statement read. Meanwhile the Igbo National Council has described the arrest of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra as a “rude shock”. The group in a statement issued in Owerri the Imo State capital on Tuesday by its National President Chilos Godsent said that the arrest of Kanu might trigger protest in most parts of the country if the Federal Government failed to handle the issue with caution. The statement which was tagged ‘Re: Arrest of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu: A mistake of the biggest order by the Nigerian Government asks government to seek peaceful means in handing the issue’. However it was an atmosphere of uneasy calm in Abia as the news of the arrest and extradition of IPOB’s leader by the Federal Government filtered into the state. A resident of Umuahia who chose to speak on condition of anonymity said “Ndigbo are finished” adding that the news came to him as “a rude shock”. Another resident asked “Is it what will be done and there will be peace?” It was also gathered that residents of Aba the commercial hub of Abia State were unusually quiet over the issue “especially as most of them have yet to hear the news”. However the Coalition of South-East Youth Leaders said in a statement by its President General of the group Goodluck Ibem and the Secretary General Kanice Igwe said “The Fulani herdsmen kill rape and maim indigenes of southern Nigerian on daily basis and none of them has been arrested or prosecuted by the Nigerian security agencies. “Nnamdi Kanu’s arrest is a direct question to Ndigbo that “how dare you speak when we kill maim and rape your women.” In Anambra most people who spoke with one of our correspondent on condition of anonymity hailed his arrest. A source said “It serves him right. He has always lacked tact. This happens to those who don’t listen to advice. The manner of his arrest must have humbled him after all his boasts. Pride always goes before a fall. I think what I just couldn’t stand about him was his arrogance.” Another respondent said “Now that the supreme leader has been captured what happens to the numerous supporters?

{"id":"866","headline":"18 judges’ Appeal Court elevation: EFCC fraud cases 1000 others to start afresh","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/18-judges-acourt-elevation-efcc-fraud-cases-1000-others-to-start-afresh","stories":"More than 1000 criminal and civil cases at various high courts in the country are expected to start afresh following the elevation of 18 judges to the Court of Appeal The PUNCH has learnt. The 18 judges are Mohammed Danjuma (Grand Kadi Niger State) Muhammad Sirajo (Plateau State High Court) Abdul-Azeez Waziri (Adamawa State High Court) Yusuf Bashir (Taraba State High Court) Usman Musale (FCT High Court) Ibrahim Jauro (Yobe State High Court) and Abba Mohammed (FCT High Court). Others include Bature Gafai (Federal High Court Awka); Danlami Senchi (FCT High Court) Mohammed Abubakar (Sokoto State High Court) Hassan Sule (Zamfara State High Court) Kenneth Amadi (Imo State High Court) Peter Affen (FCT High Court) Sybil Gbagi (Lagos State High Court) Olasunbo Goodluck (FCT High Court) Adebukola Banjoko (FCT High Court) Olabode Adegbehingbe (Ondo State High Court) and Bola Ademola (Ondo State High Court). It was gathered that among those whose cases were affected were those facing high profile fraud charges. The PUNCH reports that in the past judges who were elevated to the Court of Appeal were – based on the Administration of Criminal Act – were given fiat to continue sitting on criminal cases that had reached a substantial level at the high court. However in May 2020 the Supreme Court in the case of former Governor Orji Kalu nullified Section 396(7) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 which made it possible for the Justices to continue handling the cases after their elevation to the Court of Appeal bench. Based on the judgment the cases being handled by the newly elevated judges will now have to start afresh. Checks by The PUNCH showed that the average judge had between 200 and 300 cases pending as of the time they were elevated to the Court of Appeal. Two registrars who spoke to our correspondent on the condition of anonymity said over 1000 cases would be affected. One of the registrars told The PUNCH that the judge he was working with had about 200 cases. “My lord stopped sitting immediately his name was announced in April. He had about 200 cases which will all have to start de novo. I am aware that some judges wrote judgments but were not able to deliver them. I believe the judges who will replace them may just adopt the judgements if they agree” he said. Another registrar said his boss had 300 pending cases when he was elevated and they would all have to start afresh. “There is a case that started in 2006. The judge that was handling it was elevated and it was handed to my lord. Now that my lord has also been elevated the case will have to start de novo a second time” he said. Speaking with our correspondent Mr Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) who prosecutes high profile cases on behalf of the police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said about five of his own cases would be affected by the elevation of the judges. He however added that the elevation of judges could affect over 1000 cases Jacobs stated that the best way to avoid such was to ensure a constitutional amendment such that cases would not be affected by the elevation of trial judges. Five of my cases will start afresh that is the danger we find ourselves – Jacobs The senior advocate said “By this elevation many of my cases will have to start de novo. I have about five that have not been adjourned for judgement and once address has not been taken you cannot write judgment for those cases. So they will all have to start de novo. That is the danger of where we have found ourselves. “We have proposed that Section 356(7) of ACJA should be put into the constitution. In other jurisdictions what they do is that if you want to elevate a judge let him be aware at least six months prior. Let the CJ be aware so that new cases will not be assigned to that judge and you give him six months to conclude on cases that have gone far but nobody is listening.” On whether the cases that would be affected would be over 1000 Jacobs said “That is true. None of those judges is handling nothing less than 300 cases.” Also speaking human rights lawyer Mr. Femi Falana (SAN) said the number of cases that would have to start afresh may be about 2000. NJC should give judges six months to complete cases backdate promotions – Falana “There is no judge in Lagos that doesn’t have at least 300 pending cases. So if 18 judges are being elevated you should be talking about over 2000 cases being affected” Falana argued. The activist advised the judiciary to fix the issue by ensuring that once the process of elevation of judges has begun the NJC should give the judges six months to complete their cases and then backdate their promotion when they are inaugurated as substantive appeal court judges. The Spokesman for the Chief Justice of Nigeria Ahuraka Isah said he did not know how many cases would be affected by the elevation of judges. He however said there was nothing anyone could do because the law had to be obeyed. Isah said the 18 judges who were inaugurated on Monday ought to have been sworn-in since April but because of the need to conclude certain cases the CJN Tanko Muhammad delayed their inauguration. He said the best way to address the challenges emanating from the elevation of judges would be through a constitutional amendment. “These judges were supposed to have been sworn-in during the court workers’ strike. A day before their swearing-in the EFCC chairman met with my lord to explain that some of their cases were due for judgment and if they were sworn-in the case would become functus officious like Orji Uzor Kalu case. “This was why their inauguration was delayed and the affected judges were able to deliver judgment. We may have to amend the constitution. There are things that happen naturally and there is nothing you can do. We cannot say the judges should not be elevated.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"867","headline":"Panel affirms ex-FIIRO DG’s demotion recommends stiffer penalties","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/panel-affirms-ex-fiiro-dgs-demotion-recommends-stiffer-penalties","stories":"The committee set up to investigate the allegations against a former Director General of the Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi Chima Igwe has submitted its report backing Igwe’s demotion and recommending punishment for insubordination. Recall that the Minister of Science and Technology Dr Ogbonnaya Onu had in May 2021 written the Governing Board of FIIRO ordering the officials to stop the process of installing a substantive DG until the investigation by the Head of Service on Igwe his preferred candidate was completed. Igwe’s appointment as acting DG was opposed by the board after the PhD with which he gained promotions for over 18 years became a subject of investigation by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission. He was later demoted by the board. The PUNCH has learnt that the investigation cited by the minister was concluded in February 2021. A summary of the report obtained exclusively by our correspondent was signed by the Head of Service Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan. The head of service asked the Federal Government to advise Onu to stop interfering in the running of FIIRO and allow the board to do its job. The report dated February 8 2021 also asked the board to continue with the process of appointing a substantive DG for the agency. The head of service also recommended that Igwe apart from being demoted should be disciplined “for absence from duty and insubordination.” Two senior officials in the Ministry of Education who aided his phantom PhD were recommended for punitive sanctions. Our correspondent could not however tell why the HoS report had not been acted on by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd). Recall that after investigations by The PUNCH and later ICPC confirmed that the doctorate which he claimed he completed at the Universite D’Abomey Calavi Benin Republic in 2001 was non-existent he was removed. He was also demoted to the position he held more than 18 years ago. He initially refused to resume at the post. The minister who was said to have had several face-offs with the board Chairman Alhaji Ibrahim Gwarzo in Abuja also ordered he should be reinstated as the acting DG. The minister was alleged to have later accused the governing board of financial misappropriation but panels set up by the Federal Government to investigate found no evidence for such. The Chief of Staff to the President Prof. Ibrahim Gambari on December 4 2020 while responding to correspondence from Onu for Igwe to be confirmed as DG ordered the Head of Service to look into his certificate issue. A committee was set up and several people were interviewed including Igwe. In February the HoS submitted her report. The document stated “The Governing Board of FIIRO should immediately commence the process of the appointment of a substantive Director General in accordance with Section 2.1.3.3 (a) and (d)  of the Conditions of Service for Federal Research and Development Agencies Institutes and Colleges (Revised 2019) and in line with Mr President’s directive.  “The Governing Board should commence disciplinary procedures against Dr Chima Cartney Igwe in line with the provisions of PSR 030302 to 030307 for: absence from duty without leave or permission; refusal to carry out lawful instructions from superior authority to revert to Chief Research Officer. “The Governing Board should be commended for the transparent fair and mature manner it has handled the issue of the Ph.D of Dr Igwe. “The honourable minister (FMST) should be advised to allow the Governing Board of FIIRO to operate freely within the ambit of the provisions of extant regulations guiding the relationship between the ministry and parastatals and handle the staff matters in line with the provisions of the conditions of service in FIIRO.” On those who aided Igwe’s phantom PhD she said “The Director (Education Support Services) in the Federal Ministry of Education who approved the evaluation and the Assistant Director (Evaluation and Accreditation) who evaluated the PhD certificate of Dr Igwe should be sanctioned for lack of diligence in the manner they handled the issue of Dr Igwe.” A source said Onu and the Presidency were in possession of the report. The Senior Special Assistant Media and Publicity to the President Garba Shehu did not take his calls which rang out several times. Onu also did not take his calls or respond to a text message on the issue as of press time. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The commission said 331 accounts were created by intended registrants on the CVR online pre-registration portal which was launched at 7am on Monday. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee Festus Okoye said these in a statement he issued on Tuesday. He said “By 7am June 29 24 hours after the launch 59331 accounts were created. Within the same period 42211 applications were received out of which 27759 individuals applied for new voter pre-registration services. “Also 11 177 requested for voter review record; 1 669 applied for voter transfer; 853 asked for information update; 335 applied for replacement of lost or damaged PVCs; while 418 applicants requested for uncollected PVCs.

According to the NARD president the meeting which lasted three hours saw the Federal Government and NARD’s delegates ironing out issues affecting resident doctors across the country. Uyilawa added “As regards our members who are on the GIFMIS platform who have not been paid we made them understand that there were seven institutions and they said they would have to write to the budget office. “They also said they would have to write a letter to the Head of Service to enable the doctors in those institutions to go through capturing and verification processes for the IPPIS platform as the head of service herself placed an embargo on it. “For the hazard allowance we were told that it does not only concern the resident doctors but all doctors in Nigeria.

The church also said since the televangelist’s death was announced it had received tributes from 195 countries adding that its followers on Facebook had increased by over 600000. The SCOAN asked the public to disregard reports about anyone succeeding the charismatic leader saying there was no such development yet. The church stated these in Lagos on Tuesday during a press briefing to officially announce programmes for his burial. The briefing led by a Briton Dr Gary Tonge also had members of the church Ayodeji Olabiwonu Col. Andy Aniboli and Ugochi Aluka in attendance. TB Joshua died on Saturday June 5 2021 just seven days to his 58th birthday. Tonge who is a friend of the ministry said TB Joshua’s death was by divine will. He said “His supernatural home call was met with an outpouring of millions of testimonies and tributes from 195 countries – representing every tribe every tongue and every nation on the face of the earth. “The news of his departure also led to an increase of 600000 followers on the TB Joshua Ministries Facebook Page reaching a total of 6200000 — the largest of any religious figure in Africa.” While fielding questions from journalists Tonge described Joshua as a passionate and single-minded man who followed Jesus Christ. “If you want to know how he impacted me the most it was his refusal to be distracted by whatever the situation around was whether it was criticism. He made the decision that he would stay through to God with whom he had a covenant and that had a massive effect on those around him” he added. According to the burial programme released by the church there will be a candle light procession in honour of the cleric on July 5 followed by a tribute service (July 6) and a service of songs (July 7).

Briggs made the demand in a statement on Tuesday titled ‘Professor and His Executive Should Not Misrepresent Ijaw Nation.’ According to her the Ijaw people had lost confidence in Okaba and other officials of the apex Ijaw socio-cultural organisation “to pilot the affairs of Ijaw people of today tomorrow and the future of our children and their children.” She warned that failure by them to quit would result in the formation of a parallel pan-Ijaw platform. She argued that Okaba and his delegation informed Buhari that the Ijaw ethnic nationality was interested in remaining with ‘One Nigeria’ contrary to the age-long agitation for self-determination by Ijaw people. She insisted that after reading through Okaba’s address “Ijaw people disagree with you when you state categorically and assured President Buhari that Ijaw people do not desire to leave Nigeria and believe in one united Nigeria. Nigeria is not and has never been a united Nigeria.” Briggs said “If INC is representing the people of the Ijaw ethnic nationality INC should stand by the demand for self-determination for Ijaw. “When did Ijaw people gather to tell INC to go and tell President Buhari that Ijaw people believe in the united nation of Nigeria? “Which Ijaw people from which of the clans of the three zones of Ijaw nation told you that Ijaw nation will remain one Nigeria? “The entire executive of the INC should resign as Ijaw nation has no confidence in the executive. “Failure to resign the Ijaws have a right to create another Ijaw organisation that will serve the Ijaw today tomorrow and our grand children’s future.” She described the visit to Buhari as “a waste of time and an embarrassment to Ijaw nation as it was not undertaken in the interest of the INC and the Ijaw people.” Kidnappers’ driver to die by firing squad for Bayelsa doctor bizman’s abduction.

Their decomposing corpses were found in their Warri GRA residence on Monday June 28 2021. Sources hinted that policemen from the Area Command Warri were at the scene in the early hours of the day just as welders were mobilised to break the lock on the gate and doors to enable police operatives and sympathizers to gain access to the house apparently following foul odour oozing out of the premises. In a statement signed by his media assistant Monoyo Edon the former governor said he was “heart-wrenched over the barbaric murder” of the couple adding that the news was more touching because his wife Mrs Roli Uduaghan was a niece of late Pa Ayomike. Uduaghan urged security agencies to “launch a rapid and thorough investigation into the murder of the founder of the Warri Choral Society and his wife” who until her death was a senior lecturer at the Delta State University Abraka. He said “The Ayomikes were very peaceful and quiet people. Why would anyone want to kill them and in the most dastardly manner in which they were killed? This sad event has thrown my family and everyone close to the Ayomikes into a state of deep grief. “A respected Itsekiri and community leader late Pa Ayomike was a renowned economist who graduated from the London School of Economics.

Al Jazeera reports that Zuma did not appear at the inquiry led by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo in February after which the inquiry’s lawyers approached the court to seek an order for his imprisonment.  “The Constitutional Court can do nothing but conclude that Mr Zuma is guilty of the crime of contempt of court” judge Sisi Khampepe said on Tuesday. Zuma 79 is accused of enabling the plunder of state coffers during his nearly nine-year stint in office. “This kind of recalcitrance and defiance is unlawful and will be punished” Khampepe said.  “I am left with no option but to commit Mr Zuma to imprisonment with the hope that doing so sends an unequivocal message … the rule of law and the administration of justice prevails. “The majority judgement orders an unsuspended sentence of imprisonment for a period [of 15 months]” she declared ordering Zuma to hand himself over within five days. A spokesman for Zuma told South Africa’s eNCA television channel that the former president would issue a statement later. The commission of inquiry was set up by Zuma under pressure over mounting scandals shortly before he was removed in 2018 by the ruling African National Congress. But he testified only once in July 2019 before staging a walkout days later and accusing the commission of bias. He then ignored several invitations to reappear citing medical reasons and preparations for another corruption trial. He presented himself again briefly in November but left before questioning.

The NLC President Ayuba Wabba said this in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday in reaction to the threat by Governor Nasir El-Rufai to set up a judicial commission of inquiry into the protest and strike in May by the state workers. Following the mass retrenchment of workers in the state the NLC had carried out the three-day protests and strike. But in the statement titled ‘Kaduna workers are not slaves Kaduna workers have rights’ the congress insisted that the sacked workers have families and dependents to cater for vowing to protect their rights and dignity. The union also blamed the state government for the killing of one of the students protesting the hike in tuition on Monday. It stated “Furthermore it is sickening that not being satisfied with destroying the livelihoods of workers the state government has graduated to killing students. ‘’The  actions of the Kaduna State Government demonstrate complete  contempt for the present and future labour force in Kaduna State.  Workers are not slaves. They have families. They have dependents to take care of. They have rights.’’ Commenting on El-Rufai’s threat to bring the NLC to account for mobilising workers in the state for protests and strike Wabba said the next round of industrial action would be total. He noted “This time it will be total and in defense and protection of the rights of Nigerian workers and pensioners whom Mr  Nasir El-Rufai relentlessly seeks to convert to his foot carpet. The Nigeria  Labour Congress will not allow such to thrive in spite of El-Rufai’s  threats some of which border on outright criminality and brigandage. “The threat by a supposed civilian government to use a judicial commission of inquiry to address a pure industrial dispute is totally unprecedented in our history as a country.”   Copyright PUNCH.

Mahdi had been taken into custody for allegedly inciting the public against the trio. Mahdi who was arraigned before a Federal High Court sitting in Kano on six counts bordering on criminal defamation pleaded not guilty to all the offences. The prosecution counsel ACP Simon Lough accused Mahdi of alleged violation of his bail conditions and publishing 32 new defamation episodes from March 2021 to June 28 2021 against Masari on the internet. Mahdi was said to have accused Masari of squandering N62bn  of Katsina treasury funds squandering N64bn security votes and saying that the governor approved N500n for the All Progressives Congress meetings in Abuja.

The demolition followed the enforcement of the law on anti kidnapping which prescribed among others demolition of any property used as kidnappers den and haven for other violent crime activities in the state. The police had arrested two members of the gang who were accused of terrorising the people of Sankera comprising Logo Ukum and Katsina Ala local government areas .

The governor said the state would seek accountability for the Nigerian Labour Congress’s actions in the state by setting up “a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the events of May 2021.” He explained that it was hiring over 10000 staff because rightsizing obliged the government to continuously recruit teachers doctors nurses and other qualified staff to provide vital service. A statement by the Special Adviser on Media and Communication Mr Muyiwa Adekeye on Monday quoted the governor to have assured the President that “KDSG is determined not to allow a repeat of the pains economic losses and the restraints of freedom that the NLC inflicted on the people of Kaduna State.” Alluding to the NLC’s renewed threat of strike action the statement noted the NLC had demonstrated that it did not even believe in equality among its own members by describing the transfer of one KDSG employee to a place where other civil servants were serving as victimisation. “KDSG employees are serving with dedication in Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area amidst all the challenges.

{"id":"949","headline":"Presidency taking N’Delta people for granted says PANDEF","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/presidency-taking-ndelta-people-for-granted-says-pandef","stories":"THE Pan Niger Delta Forum on Monday reacted to the response of the Presidency to the threat by a militant group Niger Delta Avengers describing it as a sign of insincerity. PANDEF told The PUNCH that the Presidency’s reaction was an indication that it (Presidency) was taking the Niger Delta people for granted having failed to implement the region’s 16-point agenda. Recall that the Avengers had on Saturday threatened to resume attack on oil installation with a view to crumbling the nation’s economy. But the Presidency said the threat from the militant group was curious and unnecessary because it (threat) was coming barely 48 hours after the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) met with Niger Delta Leaders and the Ijaw National Congress at the Presidential Villa where germane issues received response. However the PANDEF’s spokesman Ken Robinson said the response from the Presidency was an indication that the Federal Government was unserious with issues concerning the region. Robinson said “Clearly the response of the Presidency shows that this Presidency is not serious; it is not sincere and it is taking the people of the Niger Delta for granted. So we cannot advise the Federal Government on this because they (FG) have no excuse and they know what to do but they are afraid to do it. “Remember PANDEF led a delegation to visit Mr President on the November 1 2016 and we presented what became the 16-point agenda for the holistic development of the Niger Delta to Mr. President. “As we speak today you are aware that only one and half of those 16 items have been given attention; the Maritime University in Delta State and the Ogoni clean-up. Apart from that the Federal Government has done nothing. “The pronouncements of the Vice-President in 2017 including the directive that oil firms should relocate their headquarters to Niger Delta have not been implemented” he said. INC keeps mum Meanwhile the Ijaw National Congress has kept silent on the Presidency’s statement. President of the INC Prof. Benjamin Okaba was evasive when one of our correspondents called him on the phone to react to the position of the presidency. Okaba had claimed to be in “a noisy place” and could not speak on the issue when called on the phone but accepted request that the question be sent to him via text message. He however did not reply to the text message despite the fact that a reminder was also sent to him afterwards. When contacted again after some hours the INC president acknowledged he had seen the text message promising to work on it and revert. But he had yet to do so as of the time of filing this report.

{"id":"950","headline":"Border corruption: Security agents smugglers worsen subsidy crisis flout Buhari’s order","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/border-corruption-security-agents-smugglers-worsen-subsidy-crisis-flout-buharis-order","stories":"Facts have emerged about how security agents and border communities aid smuggling of petroleum products thus worsening the fuel subsidy crisis in the country. Our correspondents who visited border communities in Ogun Adamawa Katsina Sokoto Borno Taraba and Kwara states observed how security agents turned a blind eye to petroleum products smugglers after receiving bribes from them. Recall that the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) had in a memo issued through the Nigeria Customs Service on November 6 2019 ordered that petroleum products should not be supplied to petrol stations within 20-km of borders as part of efforts to check the smuggling of the products. But the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mele Kyari on Wednesday last week partly attributed the rise in Nigeria’s daily consumption of petrol to 102 million litres in  May to smuggling. On Monday The PUNCH reported that petrol landing cost increased to N232 while subsidy on the product rose to N5.58bn. In Katsina State The PUNCH learnt that smuggling of petrol was a lucrative business in border communities. Although petrol sells for between N163  and N 165 per litre in the state  smugglers who buy the product in Nigeria sell thrice that price in the Niger Republic. The state shares borders with the  Niger Republic at  Magamar-Jibia and Kongolam. But it was gathered that there were more than 1000 illegal routes that were used by petrol smugglers. A commercial driver who plies the Katsina-Jibia route revealed that fuel smugglers were both Nigeriens and Nigerians. Fuel smugglers  move freely on Katsina-Jibia highway after bribing security agents – Driver Another commercial driver stated “The security agents on the  Katsina-Jibia highway cannot claim not to know the smugglers. Once the  security agents are given money depending on the quantity of the smuggled fuel and the bargaining power of the driver  the smugglers move freely along the highway until they get near Jibia where they make a detour  to  illegal routes instead of passing through the official border at Magamar-Jibia.” Blame security agents we have 30 checkpoints along Katsina-Jibia road – Community leader A community leader in Jibia Mallam Gide Dahiru in an interview with The PUNCH said security operatives should be blamed for fuel smuggling. Gide who is the Chairman of Jibia People’s Forum said “Instead of labelling our people smugglers  security operatives at the various checkpoints between Katsina and Jibia should be blamed. We have over 30 checkpoints along this highway smugglers still find their way.” The Spokesman for the Katsina State Police Command  Gambo Isah said the ban on the sale of fuel within 20 kilometre-radius of border communities was still in force. He added police had been arresting those who violated the ban. Nigerian businessmen security agents smuggle petrol for Cameroonian rebels – Source In Taraba State residents of border communities told one of our correspondents that petrol smuggling was a lucrative business for security personnel manning border routes in Kashimbila in the Takum Local Government Abong in the  Kurmi LGA and Maidaga and Hainare in the Sardauna LGA. A resident who spoke on condition of anonymity said on a daily basis truck loads of petrol accompanied by armed security personnel moved out of Takum and Baissa in the  Kurmi Local Government to the Republic of Cameroon. According to the source some Ambazonian rebels in Cameroon with Nigerian business collaborators including bad elements in the  police Army immigration and Customs  are involved in the  smuggling of fuel. Another eyewitness told The PUNCH that in the Sardauna Local Government Area  there were smugglers who used informal routes. He stated “When they are caught they bribe their way through. There are also others who come in to smuggle precious stones mined in Sardauna and because of the huge money they get from gold blue Sapphire and other precious stones security personnel too are in the business of smuggling these items.” Taraba State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer  David Misal did not reply to a text message sent to his phone nor pick his  calls as of  the time of filing this report. Communities act as informants for smugglers – NCS The Public Relations Officer of the NCS in Borno and Yobe states Joshua Iliya in an interview with The PUNCH admitted that there was petrol smuggling  in the states Iliya however blamed border communities for the crime. He stated “They work in active collaboration with the villagers. The villagers know them. They are part of the villagers and some of them are often being celebrated as heroes in those communities. “When our personnel go on patrol the residents inform them of our presence and the smugglers will refuse to show up until we leave. Some of them often buy phones for their informants.” In Adamawa State a security agent who spoke to one of our correspondents in confidence said the Federal Government’s ban on sale of fuel within  20- kilomtre radius of borders was being flouted. A resident of  Belel a border community in the Maiha Local Government Area of the state Abubakar Idris  said there was a  depot of petrol in the area for smugglers of fuel to Cameroon. Kwara security agents seize Jerry cans turn a blind eye to big-time smugglers using tankers In Kwara State border communities smugglers buy petrol at filling stations in Baruten and Kaiama local government areas which share borders with the Republic of Benin. No fewer than 100 fuel stations exist in the two rural local areas. The PUNCH  learnt that although security agents under the aegis of the Joint Border Patrol had  seized thousands of Jerry Cans used for smuggling  tankers were not being impounded. A resident of the Chikanda stated that while the security agents were hard on those using Jerry cans to smuggle fuel they connived with “big-time smugglers” to move petrol to other countries. The source “These big-time smugglers load the petroleum products in tankers which they move near the borders during the day time and with the connivance of Customs officers they drive the tankers to cross the border in the night. At times you will see up to five or more fully loaded tankers parked at a point in Ilesha Baruba and they will move in a convoy to cross the border in the wee hours.” When contacted the  Coordinator of the Joint Border Patrol  Olugboyega Peters said that the allegations were not true. Peters said that security agents recently intercepted a petroleum tanker which was announced at a press conference in Ilorin. He said that though there were about 100 petrol stations located in the 112 -kilometre road stretch from Ilesha Baruba to Chikanda only 10 trucks were allocated to the area on a weekly basis. “The way the trucks are released and monitored from the depot with records from the NNPC and the Department of Petroleum Resources and escorted by the security agencies it is not possible for the tankers to be ferried across the borders” Peters said Our correspondents observed that there were no fewer than 10 checkpoints manned by customs immigration and police along routes leading to each of Ogun State’s borders  with the Republic of Benin. It was learnt that instead of enforcing the ban  on the sale of fuel within 20- kilometres radius of the borders including Idiroko and Ilara security agents  turned a blind eye to fuel smugglers.  In Ogun security agents buy petrol in jerry cans take it to Benin Republic to sell A resident and youth leader  in one of the areas  who spoke in confidence with The PUNCH  said “The  fact is they (security agents) are present everywhere. It baffles us how petrol and other products are smuggled to Benin Republic. “Our findings show that they connive with smugglers who  move the  product out at night. “It gets worse after the ban on the sale within   20-km radius.  Security agents buy fuel in their cars and go and sell it in Benin.  Their routes include Bebe and Igolo.” Fuel smuggling done by residents not our men – Customs But the NCS  denied allegations that its officers in some northern and south-western states were assisting smugglers to transport petrol out of  the country. The Public Relation Officer of NCS Joseph Attah  in a telephone interview with The PUNCH said the alleged smuggling was not perpetrated by Customs officers but residents who were making the allegations. He said “I will not say that there is no smuggling and most of these illegal operations are assisted by residents of the communities. “Some of the people in the communities sabotage our efforts and help smugglers to sneak in these goods.” He disclosed that the service had also been efficient in enforcing the 20-km radius restriction which had brought the criticism of residents in the border communities. “The complaint we get from those who smuggle petrol is that our enforcement of the 20km radius from the border is even affecting legitimate businesses and also the residents of some of these villages which are at the borders are complaining against customs for making it near impossible to get petrol for their legitimate businesses” he added. Report our men involved in smuggling says NIS On its part the Nigerian Immigration Service asked residents of border communities to identify its men who were being accused of collaborating with smugglers. The service’s Public Relations Officer Amos Okpu stated this in an interview with one of  our correspondents. He assured all that such persons would be made to pass through the NIS’ disciplinary process. Okpu said “The Nigeria Immigration Service’s National Border Management Strategy for 2019 to 2023 has five framework areas and one of those is to strengthen the credibility of the NIS with contiguous cross-border communities. When we deepen community contributions to manage borders in their home areas we can run a more effective and transparent border management. “The comptroller-general understands that community leaders opinion leaders and even transporters are all stakeholders in the border security of our country. This is why he has been visiting these communities across the country. He has been to Adamawa and just last week he was in Katsina at Magama-Jibia a border town between Nigeria and Niger republic. Why?  To seek partnership with locals to ensure border security. “If you find  our officers indulging in any smuggling activity identify them through their name tags and report them to us. I can assure you that the Immigration service will apprehend such an officer and pass him through the disciplinary processes and if found guilty he will be dismissed.” Our troops can’t engage in such criminal activity – Army Also the Director of Army Public Relations Onyema Nwachukwu said the troops had no time for such criminal activities. He added that  economic saboteurs who could not go about their usual business were  behind the insinuations. Onyema in an interview with The PUNCH said “Troops of the Nigerian Army are on a daily basis engaged in tackling serious security challenges  across the country ranging from terrorism  insurgency  banditry to kidnapping ethnic rivalry and conflicts and cattle rustling. “Our hands are full with these operational engagements. I really wonder how anyone could imagine that our troops make out time for activities such as indulging in smuggling petroleum products across the country’s borders. “I presume that this insinuation is only a manifestation of the saying that ‘when you fight corruption  corruption fights back.” Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"951","headline":"Ogun secondary schools’ students in street fight as gambling colleagues die","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/ogun-secondary-schools-students-in-street-fight-as-gambling-colleagues-die","stories":"THERE was palpable fear in some parts of Abeokuta the Ogun State capital on Monday when two public schools in the state engaged in a violent attack over the death of two of their colleagues allegedly killed during an inter-schools’ gambling competition. Our correspondent gathered that the incident involved Senior School Students of the Baptist Boys High School Saje area and students of Ilugun High School located within the Federal Housing Estate in Elega Abeokuta. They were said to have engaged one another in violent fight which lasted for several hours. It was gathered that the students of BBHS invaded the Ilugun High School with various dangerous weapons including guns cutlasses broken bottles and assorted charms to avenge the death of their colleagues allegedly stabbed to death the previous week. The incidents paralysed commercial activities and vehicular movement in some parts of the state capital. Shop owners who had earlier opened for business hurriedly shut down and scampered for safety while vehicles and commuters also deserted the area for fear of being affected by the incident. An eyewitness told our correspondent that the students shot sporadically in different directions and chanted anti-management songs to warn the Principal and teachers of the school to stay off. One of the shop owners in the area who managed to return after security operatives had taken over explained that the students of the two schools were last week involved in gambling of which those of the BBHS won massively at the expense of their colleagues in Ilugun. “The gambling however degenerated into a conflict wherein two BBHS students were stabbed with broken bottles. “One of the BBHS stabbed students died last Friday while the second one died yesterday (Sunday).

Justice Obiora Egwuatu stated this on Monday after counsel for the ICPC Ebenezer Shogunle opposed the terms of the plea bargain application the defence counsel P. A. O. Olorunnisola planned to file before the court. Recall that the operatives of the anti-graft agency had on March 15 2021 apprehended Ojerinde in Abuja following allegations of misappropriation of funds. The ICPC accused Ojerinde of alleged multiple frauds while serving as Registrar at JAMB and the National Examination Council. When called for arraignment counsel to the defendant Olorunnisola told the court that measures were underway for a plea bargain. A plea bargain is an agreement between prosecutor and defendant in which the defendant pleads guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for clemency or an arrangement to drop other charges. However Shogunle disagreed with Olorunnisola’s submission declaring that the ICPC disagrees with the terms in the application. Justice Egwuatu held that since the prosecution did not agree with the terms forwarded by the defence a written correspondence should be filed to that effect. He adjourned the hearing until July 6.

INEC National Commissioner and chairman (Information and Voter Education Committee Festus Okoye stated this in an interview with THE PUNCH on Monday night. He said “We are confident and hopeful that Nigerians will embrace this online registration. We are also confident that it will ease the way of doing business especially at the registration centre. “The portals just went up today and we have very experienced engineers; although this is a new and creative innovation we have the capacity to take care of challenges. “You know this registration is going to take place in two phases there is the online registration and the physical registration at the registration centres. The physical registration will start on July 19. Those who registered through the process will be given appointment beginning from July 19. “Then they can go to either the INEC state offices or the local government office to complete their registration. Those who are not up using the portal will also begin on July 19 for physical registration; and this physical registration will take place on July 19 only in 37 INEC State offices and 774 LG offices. “After some time we will evaluate our performance evaluate our security situation and then make a determination whether to deploy fully to the other registration centres that we have created.” INEC had accredited 31 organisations to observe the CVR while 20 more applications were being processed. Meanwhile in Katsina State many residents of Katsina state and operators of cybercafé claimed ignorance of the exercise. It was also observed that many electorate who could have done the registration on their smart phones equally claimed ignorance of the exercise. At the INEC state headquarters along Katsina-Daura road some of the commission staff members were seen enlightening the electorate on how they can carry out the registration on their smart phones. The INEC Public Affairs Officer for the state Ibrahim Abashe said “The online CVR exercise is something you can do on your smart phone.’’ However in Lagos the state INEC spokesperson Mr Femi Akinbiyi said “For now individuals are filling the form online. Then on the 19th you still go to INEC office or at the local government to complete your registration.” The All Progressive Congress Lagos chapter Spokesperson Mr Seye Oladejo said “The exercise is a step in the right direction. INEC has started to make use of online facilities to make it convenient for central voters to register. That is commendable.” The Peoples Democratic Party Lagos chapter spokesperson Mr Ganiyu Taofeek said “It is a welcome development as long as no one or party is disenfranchised in the election.” In Cross River State the Resident Electoral Commissioner Dr Emmanuel Hart in a statement warned “all those that may want to hack or undermine the system that the nation’s Cybercrime Act 2015 will be used to prosecute them.” Copyright PUNCH.

A statement by the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation Mr Donald Ojogo said the PDP was showcasing its ignorance on the matter. Earlier The South-West Publicity Secretary of the PDP Chief Sanya Atofarati had alleged that Akeredolu wanted to entice the Supreme Court with the state allocation to ensure that the yet-to-be decided governorship judgement in Ondo State was in his favour. Atofarati said “It has come to our notice that the Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu Odunayo has been negotiating the forthcoming Supreme Court judgement with the state allocations just for favouritism. “It is imperative to make this known to the general public and particularly the state labour union and its members that Governor Akeredolu has been on the move to negotiate their salaries for his gains and interests by implementing this satanic means through the ongoing half-salary tactics in the state.” But Ojogo said “That Ondo State is not insulated from this fiscal ravage is saying the obvious. Yet Akeredolu shall not follow the path of infamy and sack workers as it was in the days of PDP. It is rather equally more gratifying to evolve ingenious means to sail along than leave workers unpaid for months under the guise of paucity of funds. “It is perhaps laughable that PDP failed to realise that its position grossly violates what it represented while it held sway in Ondo State prior to the current administration. The mindless audacity to owe workers seven months as well as the brazen display of  executive recklessness that saw to the sacking of over 1000 workers have both combined to repudiate the opposition party’s thrive at demonising Akeredolu and his government. “The said press release has merely made spurious allegations aside laying a sandy foundation ahead of the PDP’s leprous efforts at the Supreme Court. There could not have been a better effort at marketing helplessness occasioned by paucity of ideas and lack of direction as displayed by the press release.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Dikio stated this when he paid a courtesy visit to the Commander of the joint task force in the Niger Delta codenamed Operation Delta Safe Rear Admiral Aminu Hassan in Yenagoa Bayelsa State. He noted that the ex-agitators who had already acquired skills would be constituted into cooperatives and attached to small and medium enterprises on three identified platforms of food security maritime security and maritime transport. The fish farm which is sited in Yenegwe area of Yenagoa was established by the administration of former Governor Seriake Dickson in November 2016 as part of its plans for economic diversification. Dikio expressed optimism that the fish ponds would help in boosting job opportunities in the region. The PAP boss said “There is a 500-pond fish farm in Bayelsa that is moribund. We are working with the government to activate the ponds to use them as training facilities for our boys to increase the employment potential in the region. “We recognise that some of them have acquired some skills and we have decided to form them into cooperatives and match them with the appropriate SMEs. We have three platforms — food security maritime security and maritime transport. “We also noted from the beginning that the major issue that led to their outpouring on the street is the lack of payment of their allowances.

Akpobari said before the change UNEP was overseeing few aspects of the clean-up adding that it was no longer in the hands of the HYPREP to decide the activities of the clean-up exercise. He recalled that the environmental report on the pollution in Ogoni land was undertaken by UNEP. “The report we are talking about was carried out by UNEP. So if they manage the clean-up they will be able to say from now to three months’ time; we want to achieve this. “Imagine the last administration… they were supposed to spend $800m in four years.

{"id":"961","headline":"Fee-hike protest: Casualties unknown as police clamp down on Kaduna students","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/fee-hike-protest-casualties-unknown-as-police-clamp-down-on-kaduna-students","stories":"A protest over the hike in tuition fees by the College of Education Gidan Waya in the Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna State has claimed the life of one student while another was injured. The college is located in Southern Kaduna. The students were said to be protesting against tuition fee hike by the state government. A witness who did not want to be identified told our correspondent that security operatives were called from Kafanchan shortly after the commencement of what he “peaceful protest” which later turned violent. According to the witness security operatives fired live bullets into the crowd which killed the student. He explained that the students blocked the major highway in front of the school thereby preventing free flow of traffic and forcing motorists off the road. The Provost of the College Alexander Kure confirmed the incident on Monday. The provost said “The incident happened on the highway and not inside the school. I was told by the security that one student was killed and another injured. I offered an ambulance to take the corpse to the mortuary and the other person that got injured to the hospital for treatment. “The school was shut yesterday for mid-semester break and students are to resume next Monday. I don’t know why they were protesting.” Reacting the National President of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union Jonathan Asake alleged that two students were killed by the operatives. He said it was unfortunate that students would be mowed down by security men in 21st century Nigeria. Asake a former House of Representatives member said “I have confirmed that it was not one student that was killed. Initially one died and three were injured. Now somebody has just called me that the second person has died. And mind you these students were protesting peacefully and the security went in there with live ammunition and gunned them down. Now the question is why were these students protesting? The hike in school fees is too much and both students and parents have shown their grievances on this. “You may recall that in 2016 21000 teachers were sacked and most of them were not paid their entitlements and most of them had to withdraw their children from school; most of them even died without receiving their entitlements. And again thousands of civil servants were sacked in the same manner. And the herdsmen attack has been going on across our communities displacing many people and children. The Kaduna State Police Command however said one student died while three were injured. The command’s Public Relations Officer ASP Mohammed Jalige said the operatives were forced to use minimum force after the protest turned violent. Jalige also claimed that the convoy of a military commander was blocked by the irate students. He said “Today Monday June 28 2021 around 8am the command was informed of the protest and road blockade by students of the College of Education Gidan Waya Kafanchan over the recent increase in tuition fees by the Kaduna State Government. “On receipt of the information the command immediately dispatched operatives to restore normalcy. The contingent professionally and successfully dispersed the protesters. “However around 9.30am information has it that the students re-converged and blocked the Gidan Waya- Kafanchan Federal Highway and were becoming unruly and riotous. “At a point the protesters blocked the convoy of a military sector commander injuring him and one other. The situation resulted in a fracas where three protesters were injured in an attempt to use minimal force to disperse the riotous students. “The victims were taken to the hospital for medical attention but unfortunately one person died while receiving medical attention.” Meanwhile the National Association of Nigerian Students has given Governor Nasir El-Rufai 21-day ultimatum to make amends ahead of its national congress slated for July 19 2021. The group’s President Sunday Asefon noted that all organs and sister bodies of NANS nationwide had been put on alert to relocate to Kaduna. Asefon made the declaration while addressing a press conference in Kaduna on Monday. “The Kaduna State Governor Malam Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai should consider this window period of 21 days’ notice of national congress as enough window to pacify Nigerian students or be ready to kill as many of us as he can through thugs and security and also build enough jail within the 21 days that can accommodate thousands of Nigerian students” he added.

The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja had in a judgement given ExxonMobil and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 14 days’ ultimatum to pay N81.9bn to the fishing and farming communities in the Ibeno Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. The affected fishing and farming communities in Akwa Ibom State had dragged ExxonMobil and the NNPC to court demanding adequate compensation for oil spills that destroyed their rivers streams and other sources of livelihood. The Executive Director of ERA\/FoEN Godwin Ojo described the court ruling on the case as a landmark judgement in the long walk to environmental justice and protection of the environment and livelihood. Ojo said “The judgement is also significant because payment of compensation to the victims of oil pollution will impact positively on the lives of the people of the Niger Delta suffering under the heavy burden of oil spills pollution and destruction of their livelihood. “The judgement represents a conflict arbitration resolution mechanism that will help to rekindle hope in the court system that justice may be delayed by oil companies with war chest for huge legal fees but cannot be denied. There is no more hiding place for oil companies and they should take full responsibility to comply immediately clean up and pay up compensation. By this victory the affected people will no longer resort to self-help.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

According to him most areas of the health system needed to be revamped to meet international standards. He said with all the issues bedeviling Nigeria incidents of mental health had suddenly become a challenge as most Nigerians were currently traumatised by the happenings in the society. “Most of these crimes perpetrated are drug-induced because no sane Nigerian will just go and commit crime except he is high on something. Imagine starting your day with the news of killing in the morning it leaves an impression on your mind. We need to also look into issues of mental health. “Now we have cults in primary and secondary schools; then it was in tertiary institutions but you now see children in these schools thinking of how to kill their mates.

They alleged that one of their sons 26-year-old Nonye Nwa-Omoku was shot dead by a herdsman in the community last Thursday without any provocation. An eyewitness who claimed he escaped death by the whisker said the incident occurred in the evening when they saw a herder approaching their direction. According to him “We don’t even know what happened; we just saw the Fulani man coming towards us. Next thing he shot at my direction I dodged “He was now asking where is that my brother.

Speaking a relative of the disease Confidence Wellington said the residents who were mainly farmers were now afraid of going to their farmlands as a result of the incident. “Fulani herdsmen have been threatening our people to our farmlands.

The PUNCH gathered in Abuja on Sunday that with Friday’s decision by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to approve the timetable for the party’s congresses power blocs especially state governors and party leaders with 2023 presidential ambitions had set in motion plans to ensure that loyalists emerge as leaders at the various levels. According to the timetable released by the party’s National Secretary Senator John Akpanudoedehe on Friday ward congresses will hold on July 24 2021 followed by local government congresses on  August 14 2021 and state congresses on  September 18 2021. At inception the APC had four visible power blocs based on the influence of personalities who controlled the legacy parties which came together to form the party. This played a key role in the formation of the first National Working Committee. The then interim National Chairman Chief Bisi Akande was a leading figure in the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria his successor Chief John Odigie-Oyegun came from the All Nigeria Peoples Party. Former Edo State Governor Adams Oshiomhole who is also of the ACN bloc took over from Odigie-Oyegun as national chairman. The current chairman of the National Caretaker Committee Governor Mai Mala Buni came from the ANPP. President Muhammadu Buhari’s Congress for Progressive Change became the main power bloc after the 2015 general election which he won. A member of the party caucus who spoke in confidence told our correspondent “Our membership registration has thrown open the party to members. “Like it or not  although our President Muhammadu Buhari will not be on the ballot in 2023 he will most likely be interested in who succeeds him. “I say most likely because his brand of politics before now is non-interference in party affairs. That has changed. “The most visible of the power blocs now are those of Mr President and his key loyalists from his days in the CPC (Congress for Progressive Change). They include former and serving governors ministers and powerful aides who pull the strings from behind the scene. “Our state governors and of course our national leader Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu who like him or not is a deal maker and still wields influence despite attempts to whittle it down. “Now each governor some ministers and ambitious federal lawmakers will be slugging it out during these congresses. “But the way our system is wired most governors will have their way at the end of the day. It is only logical; they control resources and they fund the party in their states. “The party recognises them as leaders at the state level. having control of the structure strengthens their power base thus giving them leverage at the national stage. “Delegates for the elective national convention will emerge from these congresses. In the event we decide to use the direct primary method used while Buhari as our candidate for his second term governors hold the aces.” Another party source said “No governor will sit idly by and allow those who are not loyal to him to emerge as officials. That will be amount to digging his own political grave. That is what is informing the intrigues in the state chapters that you are witnessing. “The National Chairman of the APC Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni is the current face of governors who control the party at the national level.” The CPC bloc is currently reaching out to others to allow it produce the next National Chairman. The Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule is currently leading the campaign for his predecessor Senator Tanko Al-Almakura who was the only governor on the CPC platform before it merged with it others to form the APC. In one of his campaign stops in Nasarawa Sule said “Two of the legacy parties; the ACN and the ANPP each produced two national chairmen of the APC. “The only legacy party that has yet to produce the national chairman is the CPC. Once the CPC is allowed to produce the next chairman of the APC during its forthcoming national convention it’s only fair to consider Nasarawa State.” Already the battle for the control of the structure is causing ripples in the South-West where Tinubu’s loyalists are battling those of Governor Kayode Fayemi in Ekiti and the Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola in Osun who are also believed to be nursing presidential ambitions. In response to questions about the issue the coordinator of a pro-Tinubu group the South West Agenda Senator Dayo Adeyeye said “I know that there is no much problem in Osun. What is happening there is just being exaggerated by people who think they can benefit from. “The governor is in charge and he enjoys the support of the party and the people. Yes there may be disagreements here and there which is normal in human interactions but it is not something to worry about. “In Ekiti where members of SWAGA are being persecuted some as you must have heard have been illegally suspended and harassed here and there. Nevertheless we are going to keep reaching out. “This action against our members is very unfortunate because whatever we are doing we are doing within the party. And our organisation is actually mobilising and winning new members for the APC and all is to the advantage of our party and I see no reason why this should be a problem. “Well this is a passing phase and it will go when people begin to appreciate what we are doing. In Ekiti State we can only ask the authorities here to have great introspection reexamine themselves and change their ways.” A pressure group within the party Concerned APC Members is however opposed to what it claims is an attempt by the party’s governors to shut out all those who laboured to establish the APC. Spokesman for the group Abdullahi Dauda said this in an interview with The PUNCH in an interview in Abuja. He said “First let me say we are opposed to the tenure elongation given to Governor Buni and others. It is part of what we have campaigned against right from the beginning. Now what they want to do is to install stooges from the ward local government and state levels so that they can decide who becomes anything in the party in 2023. We will not take it because this party belongs to all of us. “A political party is not a one man show. Without our constitution the President has the powers to extend the tenure of anybody he wants in the APC but our party is built on its constitution that constitution does not give the President the powers he has exercised on this issue. “We believe that the President was misled by these ambitious governors and we hope he will see reason to reverse it. This is not a dictatorship; it is a democracy. We will write letters to party stakeholders and the president to reverse this unconstitutional decision and if that fails we will tell you what we are doing next.” When contacted the National Secretary of the Party Senator John Akpanudoedehe said “All that Mr President did was in line with our constitution. Like I said on Friday the last National Executive Committee meeting of our party conferred on the Caretaker Committee the power of the National Convention which is the highest decision-making body of the party in line with Article 13.3 of the APC Constitution. “Under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni a peacemaker and visionary we intend to ensure that peace is restored to the party and that our congresses at the various levels are held successfully.” Asked whether the party has concluded talks on the issue of zoning he said “We will cross the bridge when we get there.” Copyright PUNCH.

The alleged infractions run into hundreds of billions including the failure by the NPA to remit about N44.21bn in taxes to the Federal Inland Revenue Services and spending N88.23bn as administrative expenses during the year. The Auditor General of the Federation Adolphus Aghughu issued various queries on the consolidated and separate financial statements of the NPA for the 2018 in an audit report forwarded to the National Assembly which was dated May 24. The House of Representatives’ Committee on Public Accounts has invited the Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi and the management of NPA to appear before it on July 8 over the queries by the OAUGF based on the audit carried out byMessrs Muhtari Dangana & Co and SIAO (Chartered Accountants). TheAuditor-General said the management of the NPA spent N409.17bn on property plant and equipment in 2018 without sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to confirm the completeness existence and valuation of the assets. Out of the money the NPA was said to have made ‘provision for depreciation charged in the accounts that would appear to be understated by N12.49bn’. The report read “It was observed during vetting that the provisions made againstfour classes of property plant and equipment namely roads and sidings wharves vessels and buoys did not correspond to the rates of depreciation reported in the financial statements. “The depreciation rates that were charged on the assets were smaller than the rates arrived at during vetting. “The understatement of depreciation by N12486991000 resulted in the apparent over statement of the Net Book value of the fixed assets and understatement of the surplus for the year by the same amount. An explanation would be appreciated.” Furthermorethe Auditor-General said wharves were disposed of by the management of the NPA at the cost of N254.83bn without evidence of remittance to the Consolidated Revenue Fund while demanding that the number of wharves disposed of the cost and evidence of remittance be provided. Also the auditor-general said the authority reduced the sum of N126.63bn in the period under review to arrive at trade receivable of N43.51bn. Aghughu said “This showed very weak debt recovery efforts on the part of the management of Nigerian Ports Authority. “The minutes of the meeting where the group decided that these debts should be impaired should be provided. Detailed explanations should be given for the inability of the authority to recover its huge outstanding receivables. The detailed schedule of all the parties involved should be furnished.” The NPA is also to explain how the N1.88bn meant for Staff Home Ownership Scheme was administered considering the fact that the authority severed relationship with Aso Savings and Loans Plc the company that served as an agent for the creation of mortgages and the subsequent collections of repayments on the same mortgages. The management which had made an advance payment of N4.65bn was asked to providea schedule showing the names of the individual contractor nature of thecontract contract sum the amount of advance granted age analysis of each of the advance and the unconditional performance guaranty supplied by the contractors should be furnished. Theauditor-general also asked the NPA to pay into the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of N2.33bn being money collected from the disputed cargo tracking note by the NPA which had been kept in a dedicated account until July 2017 when the Economic and Financial Crime Commission directed First City Monument Bank that had been the custodian of the fund to transfer the fund to an EFCC account.

The leaders included a former Military Vice-President of Nigeria Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe (retd); former Governor of Plateau State Jonah Jang; Second Republic Senator Prof. Banji Akintoye; former President-General of the Ohaneze Ndigbo Chief Nnia Nwodo; and Prof. Yusuf Turaki among 124 others. They gave the warning in a statement issued on Sunday by the Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination Chief Folashade Olukoya on behalf of the NINAS. They also warned the United Nations the African Union the European Union the United States of America the French Chinese and British governments to stop giving loans to Nigeria saying loans borrowed to Nigeria would not be repaid by the ethnic nationalities when they become independent nations. The statement read “News reaching the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination says that the Nigerian government has taken on further loans. “Again we remind the international community that Nigeria is now a disputed project. This was articulated in our press conference of December 16 2020 when we declared a Constitutional Force Majeure. “Subsequent activities as articulated at the press conferences of March 17 2021 and April 17 2021 emphasise that Nigeria remains a disputed project. Knowing this and lending to a disputed project can only be considered negligence. “For the avoidance of doubt the indigenous nations will not and cannot be expected to repay such loans or allow their assets to be used as collateral to offset the loans.” The NINAS is an umbrella body for ethnic nationalities in the Middle Belt South-East South-West and South-South pursuing a non-violent means of self-determination for its members.

So just to remember that there are still people dying around the world from COVID-19. “We want to say that we appreciate all the work that has been done by the frontline workers and sacrifices that have been made; during COVID-19 some doctors and nurses and professionals never saw their family for four weeks; they were constantly on call working night and day trying to save lives” Abayomi said.

Milland Dikio (rtd) has given an insight into how percentage slots of the reviewed scholarship scheme of the agency will be allocated to beneficiaries. Dikio gave the indication during a meeting with prominent leaders of the first phase of PAP in Yenagoa as part of engagements with ex-agitators and beneficiaries of the programme in Yenagoa Bayelsa State on Saturday. Among leaders present at the meeting were the Speaker of the Bayelsa House State of Assembly Abraham Ingobere; Paul Eris aka Ogunboss; a member of the Bayelsa House of Assembly Felix Bonny-Ayah; one Pastor Reuben and Joshua Macaiver. According to Dikio 70 per cent of the scholarship slots would be allocated to ex-agitators 20 per cent to impacted communities and 10 per cent to PAP’s discretion. Dikio however insisted that the selection of beneficiaries of the scheme would be based on merit. He also harped on the need for beneficiaries of the amnesty programme to think beyond the N65000 monthly stipend adding that his new model of “train employ and mentor programme” was designed to make ex-agitators employers of labour. The PAP boss said “We will collaborate with the various levels of government in the region to ensure we get the best out of people in the Niger Delta. We are working to ensure that people in the Niger Delta are also able to attain heights regardless of their status.” Discussing their challenges with Dikio the first phase leaders of the PAP said they had lost confidence in the programme before his appointment as its interim administrator. One of them Joshua Macaiver expressed faith in Dikio’s administration describing the strategic communication committee set up by the agency to address the problems of misinformation as a step in the right direction.

The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Femi Adesina disclosed this in a statement titled ‘Demands by Niger Delta Avengers: President Buhari’s response.’ The Niger Delta group had threatened to embark on economic sabotage unless certain demands including the development of the Niger Delta and restructuring are met. But Adesina said the text of Buhari’s speech at the meeting with the Niger Delta leaders on Friday which he reproduced in his press statement rendered the threats by the group unnecessary. The statement read “It is however curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress at the Presidential Villa and the germane issues had been responded to especially call for the restructuring of the federation and the inauguration of a board for the Niger Delta Development Commission. “For clarity and record purposes below is a full text of the speech by President Buhari on Friday June 25 2021 which renders any sabre-rattling rather unnecessary.” In the reproduced text Buhari told his guests that he was aware of the 10-point demand which the national executive of the Ijaw National Congress made to the Federal Government and assured them that his regime was addressing them. The President also said he was concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and reminded his guests that the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project had started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land. He said he had directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects were implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities. Addressing the call for restructuring Buhari had said “The National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process necessary action would not be delayed on my part. “In the same vein your call for the creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.” On the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles Buhari said “I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.” Copyright PUNCH.

The landlords in a statement made available to newsmen in Port Harcourt decried the persistent and continuous marginalisation of people from the swamp and land areas of the company’s operations in its managerial cadre. The statement signed by Onisoya Odum Chairman and Temple Sambo Secretary of the landlords called on the attention of governors of the NAOC operation areas to the treatment of the people. They vowed to declare a force majeure on the company’s operations should the cabal within the company failed to rescind its decision by reinstating and recalling the affected (marginalised) workers. Recall that on January 19 2021 the landlords had protested at Agip head office in Port Harcourt after series of letters and press conferences. In the course of the protest the group noted that some of the positions within the NAOC management system had been out of limits to people from their area. “The best brains from the Niger Delta were been removed and replaced by staff from the Igbo-speaking areas of the country. It added “The question therefore is; are there no other persons from the swamp and land areas operation of NAOC who is qualified to fill positions of a Divisional Manager? Is that position only suitable for Igbo and toxic to our people? “We hereby put all landlords of both swamp and land areas operation to be at alert; there will be a directive to shut down all NAOC operations within our communities until all issues are resolved” the statement added.

The board’s acting General Manager Dr Joy Okoro said this while speaking with journalists in Abuja. Recall that the acting Secretary FCT Health and Human Services Secretariat Dr Mohammed Kawu said last week that 91 suspected cases had so far been recorded in the FCT adding that seven deaths were recorded. But Okoro said its water had never been and would never be contaminated. She said “The treatment we put in takes care of everything. That is the essence of water treatment to take care of any possible impurity and make the resource safe for consumption.” “That is what the board has been doing and it will continue to do it because the FCTA attaches so much value to the lives of Nigerians and all residents. “So we are assuring all of them that our water is very pure very good for drinking and very potable. And it is not just one but four treatment plants at the Lower Usman Dam; and the FCT administration through the Minister Muhammad Bello continues to give us enabling environment. “We have all the chemicals for water treatment and we do carry out water treatment judiciously so as to serve our customers best quality water. Our staff work 24\/7 especially those in the production area to make sure that all the residents are well served potable water.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

{"id":"1025","headline":"Market demolition will worsen insecurity ground economy – ACF","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/market-demolition-will-worsen-insecurity-ground-economy-acf","stories":"THE Kaduna State chapter of the Arewa Consultative Forum has cautioned the state government over market demolition in the state. Although the organisation commended the state for its foresight to improve the markets but noted that demolition would negatively affect the economic status of owner and lead to insecurity in the state. “The challenges are enormous which include displacements of individuals rendering them economically vulnerable which may result in increased insecurity in the state” the ACF stated in a communiqué shortly after its meeting in Kaduna on Saturday. According to the communiqué by the state Publicity Secretary Shehu Samaila the government should consider some form of reliefs to displaced individuals either by considering allocations of alternative business places or some form of compensations where necessary before the exercise. The communiqué read by the Chairman  Alhaji Lawal Meyere acknowledged that the state under Malam Nasir El-Rufai was gradually restoring the past glory of the state. It added that the paramount of the challenges threatening progress in the state “distracting the farming culture and food production of the state and subsequently negatively affecting the economic status of individual citizens as well as the state in general is insecurity.” Consequently the ACF urged the state government to remodel the state vigilante group equipped them to achieve the desired objective. It also frowned on payment of ransom to kidnappers noting that doing so would further embolden the hoodlums. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Amid cries the University of Lagos undergraduate said “I regret killing Mr Ataga. I don’t know what my future holds but I don’t want to die. Please I don’t want to die because of this case. I have not killed before. “I was just trying to comport myself to answer questions during the parade and not that I am not showing remorse. I totally regretted everything I did and I am sorry. Mr Ataga’s family I am deeply sorry for what I did. If I had my life back I wouldn’t do anything like that. I am deeply sorry and I hope you forgive me.” Chidinma and Ataga reportedly lodged in a service apartment in the Lekki area of Lagos State and the corpse of the latter was discovered the next day in the room and the former fled thus raising suspicion of her complicity in his death. The police said they went after her and tracked her down at her father’s Alagomeji Yaba residence. Upon her arrest Chidinma attributed her action to the influence of hard drugs and alcohol. Speaking while being paraded by the police Chidinma said she met the late Ataga about four months ago. Chidinma also said that she and Ataga were “having fun” when an argument broke out and she stabbed him twice after which she withdrew N380 000 from his account using his ATM card. The police had also disclosed that an Information and Communication Technology unit recently created by the state Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu tracked the suspect who used different SIM cards– both Nigerian and foreign ones. Childhood  Chidinma said her parents separated when she was two years old and she started living with her uncle Chijioke Obi in the Mushin area of Lagos State. She added that while growing up her childhood ambition was to become either a musician or an actress.  The suspect stated “My role models were Tiwa Savage Beyonce Rihanna Genevieve and Regina Hall. I schooled in Johnson Primary School and also a government primary school in Mushin. I later went to Sidman College in Sabo Yaba. I was two-year-old when my parents separated I was little so while I was growing up I stayed with my uncle Mr Chijioke Obi in Mushin. I don’t know if he bears Izu but it was my uncle that trained me.” Drug addiction Upon completion of secondary school education the suspect said she gained admission to study Mass Communication at the University of Lagos. Asked about her assumed drug-induced lifestyle Chidinma said “I started smoking after I got into UNILAG.” She also confirmed she’s the person in a trending video showing a lady puffing out cigarette smoke while soft music plays in the background. She stated “I am the one smoking in the trending video. I started smoking a few years ago. Old-time friends introduced me to it and we don’t talk anymore. Everything started after I entered UNILAG but not actually when I am in school it could be other places. But I am not the one in the other video (dissociating herself from another trending video showing a lady exhibiting her butt).” Ataga took hard drugs drank —Chidinma On her relationship with Ataga Chidinma described him as just a friend she met a few months back faulting claims that he neither took hard drugs nor alcohol. Narrating some of the moments she spent with the deceased she said “Mr Ataga was a friend and I don’t know how to elaborate more. He has not shown me pictures of his family but he sometimes acts like he was married and not that he is married (sic). I have met him up to four or five times; he takes drugs and drinks alcohol. It is not that I am trying to put anything together.’’ Also the police said that on Thursday they released Chidinma’s father and the operator of the apartment where the incident happened Mrs Nkechi Mogbo on bail. The suspect’s father was arrested over what the police described as obstructing the arrest of her daughter while Mogbo had been in police custody after investigation identified her as the operator of the apartment. Odumosu said “Chidinma’s statement exonerated her father as she said that he was not aware of the incident. We released him. Also the lady in our custody one Mrs Nkechi Mogbo who leased the flat from the property owner and used it for a service apartment has been released on bail. “After Magbo was arrested she assisted the police because of the information she gave us. Now that we got the principal suspect and the fact that the principal suspect confessed that she singularly committed the act and equally went further to explain that she never met Nkechi Mogbo but that she only phoned her and that they transacted all the business online I have ordered her release on bail while we continue our investigation.’’    Copyright PUNCH.

In Zamfara State bandits on Thursday attacked a patrol team of Operation Hadarin Daji comprising operatives of the Nigerian Air Force and Police Special Forces in the Bundugu area of the state. An encounter between the troops and the bandits left two security operatives a police inspector and a NAF operative identified as James Okpu dead. Seven bandits were also reportedly killed during the gun duel. Sunday PUNCH learnt that the incident occurred at a time the no-fly zone directive ordered by the President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd) to curtail the activities of bandits in the state was still in force. Okpu’s family and friends have since taken to social media to mourn him. His brother Maro Okpu who posted the pictures of the deceased wrote “Why now brother? You never planned to ‘let go’ in such a hard way. (You are) always in our heart kid brother. Rest on.” Another family member simply identified as Paul also wrote on Facebook “Gone too soon my own James Azabanabhelam Egbogba Okpu.” Meanwhile one of Okpu’s relatives who spoke on condition of anonymity said a military officer close to the family first broke the news to him. The relative claimed that the commander of the deceased’s unit later called to commiserate with the bereaved family. The source said “On Thursday I got a call from someone who claimed to be the deceased’s commander. He asked after my well-being and asked if I heard what happened to my brother. I told him I heard. He then said ‘Take heart. I am sorry. May his soul rest in peace.’ I hit my phone against the floor and began to weep. “The deceased was a young man. He had been the pillar of our family ever since we lost our parents. He joined the Air Force to fend for the family. One of my brothers met me crying. He picked up the phone and called the commander. “He didn’t tell me much about what they discussed. All he just said was that we should go to Abuja. I called the commander’s number on Friday with the elders of the family being present to get information on how he died. The commander said I should call back but since then we have not been able to talk.” When contacted the Director of Public Relations and Information NAF Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet confirmed that a patrol team of Operation Hadarin Daji was attacked by bandits at Bundugu in Zamfara State. Gabkwet said the troops killed seven bandits but lost two personnel including a NAF operative. He said “There was no attack on the NAF base in Zamfara State. Instead a patrol team of Operation Hadarin Daji comprising members of the armed forces and Police Special Forces came under attack by bandits at Bundugu. “As usual our troops waded off the attack and killed seven bandits. Sadly we lost one of our gallant airmen and a police inspector.” Meanwhile Gabkwet debunked reports that armed men attacked the Air Force base in Kaduna on Saturday. He said this in a statement titled ‘No attempted attack on NAF Base in Kaduna.’ The statement read “Merchants of fake news are at it again. This time round their focus is on the premier Nigerian Air Force Base in Kaduna which they claimed came under terrorist attack in the early hours of June 26 2021. “Members of the public should please disregard the news as it is entirely false. There was nothing of such as the inhabitants of the entire base are going about their normal business without any threat whatsoever.” Referencing Saturday’s attacks the Nigerian Army said troops of Division 8 neutralised several suspected bandits in Talata Maraf Local Government Area of Zamfara State. The army said the bandits and troops engaged in a fierce gun battle during their patrol along Mayanchi-Dogo Karfe and Fagantama villages in the state. In a statement the Director of Army Public Relations Onyema Nwachukwu said troops also killed five bandits and injured others in a separate operation in Bungudu in Zamfara State. The statement was titled ‘Nigerian Army troops neutralise scores of bandits in fierce encounter recover arms and ammunition.’ It read “In the fierce encounter that ensued the bandits were overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the troops. “This led to scores of bandits being neutralised. The troops also recovered one PKT rifle large cache of ammunition and a motorcycle.  “Relatedly troops have neutralised five bandits in another encounter at Bingi village in the Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State. During the gun duel the bandits withdrew in disarray having sustained severe gunshot wounds. The gallant troops recovered one AK-47 rifle one motorcycle and three mobile phones from the routed criminals.” Bandits invade Kogi House of Assembly In a related development bandits on Friday raided the Kogi State House of Assembly Complex and carted away property worth millions of naira. The Speaker of the Kogi House of Assembly Mr Matthew Kolawole who confirmed the incident in an interview with one of our correspondents said “some armed bandits invaded the Assembly on Friday and made away with armoured cables TV sets and other office valuables.” Kolawole expressed concern over the development saying that the bandits’ invasion had exposed the porous security at the complex. “Security men attached to the Assembly Complex should sit  up in the discharge of their duty or would be made to face interrogation over their lapses in the protection of lives and property at the House of Assembly Complex” the Speaker warned. Kolawole appealed to the security agencies in the state to ensure arrest of those who invaded the Assembly to avert future occurrence. He however expressed joy that no life was lost during the attack. Ondo varsity shut as hoodlums rob rape students Meanwhile the management of the Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology Okitipupa Ondo State has ordered the closure of the institution for two weeks following the spate of insecurity on the campus. The development followed a protest embarked upon by the students last Thursday to register their displeasure over the incessant robberies at their hostels rape of female students by hoodlums and threats to their lives and property. A source told one of our correspondents that about four female students were raped by hoodlums in the last two weeks. The President of the school’s Students’ Union Government Damilola Okunomo confirmed the raping of some students saying they were tired of the level of insecurity in the school environment. Apart from the rape of female students at gunpoint Okunomo also said many students had been dispossessed of their valuables such as phones laptops and other gadgets. He said “We are tired of insecurity. Hoodlums usually come to our off-campus hostels rob students at gunpoint and rape our female students. “The school management is not doing enough as we are the ones securing ourselves by working as vigilantes most times. The situation is terrible. “We urge the school management to do its best in securing us and complete all the uncompleted hostel accommodations on the campus.” However in a reaction the Dean of Student Affairs OAUSTECH Mr Ilemobayo Oguntimehin stated that the school management was doing its best to secure the lives and property of the students. Similarly the university’s Public Relations Officer Mr Abdulazeez Adebayo said the school had already taken steps to ensure the safety of the students’ lives and property. He said “It is true that the students staged a peaceful protest and the school has been shut. The management will be meeting with all the traditional rulers and other stakeholders in the communities over the students’ security. “In few days from now  the school will organise a security summit that will involve all the stakeholders in the area.” Destroy terrorists’ enclaves COAS charges troops Meanwhile the Chief of Army Staff Major General Faruk Yahaya had charged troops of Sector 2 Joint Task Force North East Operation Hadin Kai to destroy all Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province’s enclaves in their various locations. According to a statement by the Director of Army Public Relations Nwachukwu the COAS stated this while addressing troops in Yobe State on Saturday.

{"id":"1049","headline":"Kwara APC crisis: Abdulrazaq ex-party chair disagree over campaign funding","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/kwara-apc-crisis-abdulrazaq-ex-party-chair-disagree-over-campaign-funding","stories":"Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State on Saturday broke his silence on the crisis rocking the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress saying the disagreement began before he became the governor of the state. Abdulrazaq who spoke on Saturday in Ilorin at the launch of a book titled “Otoge” written by Tony Oyeyiola traced the crisis to his refusal to fund a campaign structure that was formed without his knowledge or input as the governorship candidate. According to the governor some party chieftain who allegedly received hundreds of millions of naira as donations for the Kwara State did not deliver a kobo to him. Abdulrazaq who was represented by the deputy governor Kayode Alabi said party officials were equally barred from campaigning with him until the presidential election had been won and the pendulum was clearly swinging in his favour. He said “Since this book is about history I feel it is important to set the record straight on a few things. First the Otoge is the struggle of our people and it did not necessarily start in 2019. Every Kwaran of good conscience owned and worked for that struggle in various ways. We were only positioned by providence to lead the final lap of the breaking of the jinx that dated back many decades.  “However permit me to assert here that contrary to some claims out there the battle cry Otoge and its adoption were a product of a state-wide field research that I commissioned shortly after the primaries in October 2018. If anyone could lay claim to its copyright it has to be the Hook Nigeria a communications outfit owned by very young people. “I also need to set the record straight about the party crisis. It did not begin after the election or swearing-in. It is safe to say that those who claimed to own the party in the state at that time practically disowned me until after the President had won his election and the coast became clearer back home. Here is the story. Shortly after the primaries in October the party told me they have set up a campaign structure. Nobody consulted me before doing that even though I was the governorship candidate. “They asked me to fund the campaign structure that I was not privy to. Of course I declined it. I would later lead my own small campaign team across the state. It is on record that the party officially boycotted my campaign tours. Party officials got the instruction not to attend my campaign. A few of them can testify to this. I went round the whole of Kwara North without the party. However they stylishly joined the campaign after the presidential election when it was clear Kwarans had decided in our favour. I am not aware of any decent democracy where a candidate would not be given the privilege of shaping the direction of his own campaign. It is even worse that my campaign was boycotted because I refused to be led by the nose.  “I have told these stories of the slogan and of the party issues to disabuse the mind of Kwarans or friends of Kwara who may not have had this information. In doing so I am not claiming sole credit for the success of the struggle. Far from it I have done so simply to clear the air and this book launch offers the right platform to speak up. And for ministers governors party supporters and friends of Kwara who I later heard donated hundreds of millions of naira to support the Otoge struggle in Kwara I want to say that I did not receive a kobo of that fund. But how that money was managed or stolen is a story for another day!”  The governor congratulated the author of the work Tony Oyeyiola describing it as a commendable effort and directing the purchase of 100 copies for the government.  But the immediate past Chairman of the APC in Kwara State Bashir Bolarinwa when contacted by our correspondent denied the allegation that the governor was not consulted by the party before the campaign structure for the 2019 general elections was constituted. Bolarinwa claimed that the governor suggested a unified campaign structure for the party so as to save cost after he was consulted on the matter by party leaders. According to the ex-party chair Abdulrazaq nominated an architect Kale Belgore to be on the committee after which he allegedly turned his back on the party. Bolarinwa said “The governor has told the world the truth that he did not fund the campaign of the party. He was contacted and after approving the campaign structure headed by Chief Sunday Oyebiyi the Senatorial Chairman of APC in Kwara North Senatorial zone he nominated architect Kale Belgore to be on the campaign. The report of the committee was sent to him through his nominee but he turned his back and abandoned the party. We were desperate to win the election and change the status quo in the state. We approached Alhaji Lai Mohammed and it was the minister who funded the campaign of the party for the 2019 elections including the presidential campaign. On the donations made to the party by governors and ministers which the governor said was not delivered to him Bolarinwa said “I don’t know anything about that no donation made to the party was given to me.” On allegation that the party did not join the governor in his campaign and that it was after the presidential election that the party joined him Bolarinwa said “It is a lie. I told you that we went and approached Alhaji Lai Mohammed who went and looked for money I don’t know how and where he got the money but we went on campaign because we wanted to win the election.

{"id":"1051","headline":"Buhari orders NDLEA to raid drug hideouts in forests","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/buhari-orders-ndlea-to-raid-drug-hideouts-in-forests","stories":"The President Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). has described Nigeria’s drug war as deadlier than the fight against insurgency and banditry and other threats to the stability of the country. Buhari said this on Saturday while launching the War Against Drug Abuse initiative by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in commemoration of the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking themed “Share Facts on Drugs. Save Lives.” As the Special Guest of Honour at the launch the President urged the NDLEA to exert more effort to clear out criminal elements habiting the vast forests of the South-South and South-West; from where they plan and execute their criminal attacks and also grow marijuana. Buhari was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation Boss Mustapha. He said “I am directing the NDLEA to develop a robust risk-communication and community engagement strategy that will not only disseminate the four pillars of the plan to responsible entities but also deal with destroying production sites and laboratories break the supply chain discourage drug use and prosecute offenders as well as traffickers rehabilitate addicts and enforcement of relevant laws. “I want to particularly draw the attention of the agency to the fact that the use of many of our forests as criminal hideouts is because large swathes of cannabis plantations are hidden deep within those forests especially in the South-West and the South-South. “You may therefore need to drive these criminal elements from such hideouts because they use it for the growth of these plants and also as a repository for criminal elements to conclude and plan their adventures on our people. “On this United Nations anti-drug day I call on all families schools civil society organisations professional associations religious organisations the academia community leaders and individuals to work for the common good to rid their communities of drug use and trafficking. In his remarks Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa said over N90bn worth of cash and drugs have been seized since he assumed office 5 m0nths ago. Marwa revealed that more than 2180 traffickers have been arrested including five drug lords governing different cartels across the country He added that the agency has intercepted and seized a whopping 2.05 million kilograms of drugs across the country and 2100 drug offenders prosecuted with 500 jailed by courts. The NDLEA Boss said “While the statistics are impressive we wouldn’t deceive ourselves that we have succeeded in cleaning the Aegean stable in five months. Marwa broke the disturbing statistics that Nigeria currently ranks the highest in users of cannabis globally adding that confessions of kidnapped victims who later regained freedom have shown that illicit substances are a prime enabler of the spate of insecurity troubling the country. He said “It is not difficult to conclude that drugs have been catalysts of terrorism kidnapping banditry armed robbery and various violent conflicts that are currently Nigeria’s albatross. “The enormity of the danger of drug abuse calls for an urgent need to nip the problem in the bud. This is the reason we have redoubled our efforts in the past five months with the Maxim of Offensive Action.”  “So it wasn’t surprising when research began to give us bleak statistics. The National Drug Survey 2019 for example indicated that cannabis is the most commonly abused substance by an estimated 10.6 million Nigerians some of whom started smoking as early as 19 years of age. Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila who was represented by the Chairman House Committee on Drugs and Narcotics Francis Agwu urged the President to okay the employment of 10000 personnel for the NDLEA which he lamented was currently “understaffed” “underfunded” and “ill-equipped”. Senate President Ahmed Lawan who was also represented by the Chairman Senate Committee on Narcotics Drugs Senator Ezekiah Dimka emphasized the need for individual and collective participation to fight drug abuse. Also speaking at the event The United Nations General Assembly Antonio Guterres lamented that the world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate damage impact and to hinder a healthy recovery. Guterres was represented by the Country Representative United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Oliver Stolpe who charged law enforcement agents to hunt the criminals at the upper level of the drug trafficking chain who reap the highest profit and wreak the greatest havoc.

The French humanitarian non-governmental organisation was suspended following a discovery on Saturday that it was using a hotel in Maiduguri for training some aid workers on shooting. Zulum’s spokesman Mallam Isa Gusau who announced the governor’s directive said the French NGO was found using toy guns and simulators in training exercises at a hotel located off the Circular Road in Maiduguri the state capital. Gusau explained that residents near the hotel had reported to officials that they were hearing gunshot sounds from the hotel following which government officials reported the matter to the GRA Divisional Police Headquarters which oversees the hotel’s location. The police reportedly found some toy pistols at the hotel while two trainers both Nigerians were arrested. Pending the outcome of the police investigation Zulum has directed the sealing of the hotel and ACTED’s suspension from any humanitarian activity in the state. Gusau said Zulum “acknowledges and deeply appreciates the roles of credible NGOs which have been providing critical humanitarian interventions in different parts of Borno.” “He assured them of the government’s continued cooperation and support while also upholding obedience to prevailing laws policies and rules guiding all activities and actions across the state” the statement read. However two ACTED workers arrested by the police Chinedu Charles and Abdullahi Mustapha during interrogation said they were using the toy guns to rehearse for a drama in which they were to act as Civilian Joint Task Force members. “I came out of the hotel with a gun held up in the air and within three minutes the whole place was filled with people. The gun was a toy gun. We were using it for rehearsal. We were to act as Civilian JTF members in the drama” Charles told the police. Also Mustapha said “The guns are toy guns. One of them was even broken. Women and children started running when they saw the guns. Our officers are French and they were there with us.” Meanwhile the state Commissioner for Youths and Sports Development Saina Buba said the ACTED’s attitude could not be tolerated. “This government is not like other past governments. This is a serious government. We can’t tolerate this kind of attitude in our state. The governor said we should keep them here (at the police station) for now. This particular NGO was banned from the state last week” Buba said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Evelyn and Joshua were married for 31 years and had three children together until his death on June 5 at the age of 57. France-based AfricaNews reports that elders of the church met and declared Evelyn the successor to the late televangelist. A top aide of the late cleric was quoted as saying “Someone must take charge immediately and give spiritual direction on the mode of service continuity. So much spiritual and financial effort went into building SCOAN and it cannot just waste away (sic).” Evelyn who met TB Joshua over 30 years ago was said to have been serving as the second-in-command to her husband before his death earlier this month performing the role of a preacher and offering counselling to church members. The church had earlier said Joshua would be buried at the church contrary to the wish of the traditional rulers in Arigidi Akoko the late televangelist’s hometown in Ondo. The weeklong event will take place from July 5 to 11. According to a caption-free Instagram post by the late cleric’s friend and media mogul Dele Momodu on Friday night a candlelight procession will be held on July 5 while a tribute service and service of songs\/all-night praise will be held on July 6 and 7. Joshua’s lying-in-state will be held on July 8 while the funeral and interment will follow on July 9. A thanksgiving service is scheduled for July 11.

The Chukwudi Umeaba-led faction held its primary at the Paul University playground in Awka and elected Senator Ugochukwu Uba as the party’s candidate for the November 6 governorship poll. According to the returning officer Chief Obidi Ebede Uba defeated his closest rival Godwin Ezeemo with 275 against 114 votes. Ebede said there were 665 accredited delegates. On the other hand the faction led by Ndubuisi Nwobu held its primary at the Prof Dora Akunyili Women Development Centre and had yet to announce the winner of the primary as of the time of filing this report. The Secretary of the Anambra State Governorship Primary Electoral Committee of the PDP and Deputy Governor of Edo State Philip Shaibu who oversaw the exercise said the committee was determined to conduct a free fair and acceptable primary. “At the moment less than 200 out of the about 300 super delegates have filed out for accreditation according to their local government areas of origin” he said. Shaibu said three aspirants dropped their ambition and pledged loyalty to the party. The aspirants included Dr Tony Nwoye and Emeka Etiaba (SAN). “I am determined to conduct a free fair and credible primary and that was why we engaged ourselves inside to make sure that all the fears of the aspirants were sorted out. At the end of the day we all agreed to go ahead” Shaibu added.  We’ll comply with court ruling on Anambra PDP exco –INEC The Independent National Electoral Commission has in a letter to the PDP National Chairman Prince Uche Secondus drawn the party’s attention to a court judgement in favour of the Umeaba-led PDP and asked the party to comply with the court’s judgement. The letter was signed by the secretary to the commission Rose Oriaran-Anthony. INEC stressed that it would comply with the judgment of a High Court in Abuja dismissing the sacking of the executives of the Anambra State PDP. The court had on June 9 2021 dismissed the applications filed by the national office of the PDP and two others. But INEC in a letter addressed to Secondus dated June 25 said it had received the High Court judgement dismissing the sacking of the Anambra PDP executives. INEC said “The commission has been served with the judgement of the High Court of the FCT delivered on June 9 2021 in suit No. FCT\/HC\/774\/2012 between Samuel Anyakorah vs PDP & ors regarding the Anambra State PDP executives. “Consequent upon the above the commission wishes to intimate you on the need to comply with the same. Accept the assurance of the commission’s high regards please.” Justice Olukayode Adeniyi of a High Court in Maitama Abuja had in a ruling held that the three applicants – the PDP Chief Ndubuisi Nwobu and Uchenna Obiora – failed to make out a case to warrant the grant of their application that sought to stay the judgment pending the determination of the appeal. He held that they did not show that the non-staying of the judgment would either render their appeals nugatory or make it impossible for the party to conduct its primary for the forthcoming governorship election. The judge voided all the activities engaged in by the party since June 9 when the judgment was delivered including the elections it conducted on June 10 and 11 to elect a three-man ad hoc ward delegate that would vote at the primary of the PDP scheduled for June 26 2021. Justice Adeniyi said the statement made on June 9 by the state Publicity Secretary of the PDP Anambra in which he disparaged the court and its judgment was an affront to the court adding that they did not expect a court they had insulted to grant them indulgence.

{"id":"1063","headline":"Zamfara bandit boasts about exploits in trending video","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/zamfara-bandit-boasts-about-exploits-in-trending-video","stories":"In a video which went viral on Saturday a notorious bandit operating within the precincts of Zamfara forest boasted about his operations and exploits against the Nigerian military. The bandit identified as Dankarami (meaning ‘Small’ in Hausa) was seen holding a rifle while surrounded by a crowd and granting an interview to some persons. In the video which lasted four minutes and 40 seconds the dreadlocks-wearing bandit was seen boasting about some of his exploits especially ambushes against military convoys. It was not clear when the video was shot but it is believed to have been shot a few months ago. The amateur video is believed to have been taken in Zurmi forest where Dankarami holds sway. He told his listeners “My strength and that of Allah gives me success. Fire! Anyone who touches it knows that it’s not sweet. I swear they left us alone. That is why I came here. “I called the Emir who was removed and now lives in Gusau. I told him to let us live in peace. I told him I did not come back home for terrorism. “I came home to live in peace with my parents. If he hears there is trouble anywhere and I’m involved he should call our parents to speak to us but his reply was that he could never live with a terrorist. Was that not so? “I switched off my phone removed my SIM card and since then I only use the phones of my boys to call.” Dankarami further said “After three months they brought in soldiers and took them to Dumburum. I allowed them. My house was under the road they passed; I let them. “I relocated my wives and stayed alone with my boys. One evening on the fourth day on their way from Gusau I dealt with them (soldiers). “They sent another team and I killed half of them. Another evening they ambushed my brothers who were bringing me supplies and seized their motorcycles. They joined forces with Niger State. I dealt with them. I’m still here till tomorrow. “No one can arrest me unless I let them. Whatever they (my boys) want to do they won’t do until I say so. The other day they went to Zurmi and kidnapped children small children. I was sleeping at home; they said there were 40 people. I took them back. Since our parents pleaded with us to return the children did we collect a single naira? Did anyone give us anything? “So if I give my word to a person if the person rejects or accepts it it’s fine I don’t care. I can only say this: no love exists between me and those people across the road to the North. Everyone knows I have no business with them. My boys don’t operate along Jaja where they kill innocent people. We don’t kill innocent people.” It was not clear if Dankarami’s claim of some children was in reference to 40 children kidnapped alongside 160 others from a school in Niger State in May 2021. For the past five years the northwestern part of Nigeria has become engulfed by attacks carried out by bandits who have carried out vicious attacks on local communities killing scores of people and kidnapping as many as they can for ransoms. Zamfara Katsina and Kaduna states are the epicentres of the growing crisis. In the first half of 2020 alone at least 1126 people were killed by bandits in northern Nigeria according to Amnesty International. In the last six months hundreds of students have also been kidnapped in at least five separate incidents. In some cases students have been killed by their kidnappers even after ransoms were paid.

{"id":"1065","headline":"NDDC board: Niger Delta militants issue 14-day ultimatum to FG","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/nddc-board-niger-delta-militants-issue-14-day-ultimatum-to-fg","stories":"Militant group Niger Delta Avengers has threatened to return to the creeks in an apparent move to resume hostilities including the destruction of oil installations. In a statement on its website on Saturday the avengers said they were returning in an ‘Operation Humble’ and vowed to destroy targeted oil installations operating in the region. The threat by the group may not be unconnected with the continued delay by the Federal Government to constitute a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission. A coalition of ex-militants had recently in Akwa Ibom State threatened to embark on mass protests across the country if a substantive board of the NDDC was not reconstituted within 14 days. The coalition argued that it was illegal for the NDDC’s Interim Management Committee to supervise the forensic audit of the agency. But the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Senator Godswill Akpabio has assured that the forensic audit report would be ready soon and the board of the interventionists agency would follow. However the avengers after a meeting of its high command said it had lost confidence in all sociocultural groups like the Pan Niger Delta Forum saying the groups were hobnobbing with the Federal Government which they said was turning a deaf ear to issues in the region. The avengers said “This operation shall be code-named ‘Operation Humble’ and it’s aimed at bringing down targeted oil installations in the Niger Delta capable of humbling the economy into a permanent recession. “This mission is also targeted at political actors who are collaborating with the Nigerian government to undermine the interest of the Niger Delta people. “There is no doubt that the Nigerian government has continued to turn a deaf ear to our demands and the rising challenges in the country because the pipelines that crisscross our lands are left untouched allowing dollars to flow into the federal treasury on a daily basis for mismanagement. “We shall spare no single oil installation within our range of strategic targets marked for destruction in the coming days and we bet the Nigerian government will be humbled to return to the drawing board and chart an all-inclusive course by the time we are done with our action plan. “Members of our strike teams across the Niger Delta are commanded to be on red alert awaiting precise strike plans as mapped out by the high command of the NDA.” Copyright PUNCH.

The government was said to have been paying salaries of the workers in the state in percentages for the past few months. The State Executive and Administrative Councils of the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria Ondo State Chapter at the end of its emergency meeting on Saturday resolved that the workers would no longer accept partial salaries because of the high prices of essential commodities. This was contained in a communiqué issued after the meeting held in Akure the state capital. The labour union empathised with workers on the current economic situation in the country especially the astronomical increase in the prices of food and other essential items.

{"id":"1070","headline":"Alleged hidden account: NNPC’s $223m fully paid Polaris Bank tells Reps","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/alleged-hidden-account-nnpcs-223m-fully-paid-polaris-bank-tells-reps","stories":"More facts have emerged on the issues surrounding the $223m lodged with Polaris Bank by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation since 2012. Following the disclosure made by the Acting Managing Director of the bank Mr Innocent Ike while appearing at a public hearing before the House of Representatives Ad Hoc Committee on the Assessment and Status of All Recovered Loots from 2002-2020 on Thursday  our correspondent intercepted a copy of the letter titled: ‘Re: Invitation to Investigate Hearing in Respect of  NNPC Deposit of $223862000 with the Bank.’ The letter which was dated June 21 and sent to the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Assessment and Status of Recovered Loots Adejoro Adeogun through the office of the bank’s general counsel Mr Segun Tawoju provided extensive insight into the alleged controversial deposit. The letter which had 10 annexures copiously provided details and revelations on the issues surrounding the transaction. The committee had during the sitting queried why the money had spent seven years with the bank without any action adding that the bank must have thought the money had been forgotten. Adeogun the committee chairman while grilling the Managing Director of Polaris Bank said   “You have about six years when this deposit was in your custody. It is impossible to forget $300m. Were you thinking it had been forgotten?” He accused the bank of exhibiting carelessness when it comes to money deposited by the Federal Government. The bank had through its letter explained that following the regulatory intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria in the defunct Skye Bank on July 4 2016 the new board and management immediately set out to address the various irregularities and shortcomings chief of which was the inability of the bank to remit the NNPC deposits which had been in the bank’s custody for several years to the Treasury Single Account as directed by the Federal Government of Nigeria due to liquidity issues. Ike explained that the said money which was lodged with the bank by the NNPC was at no time hidden from any public or government agencies noting that the bank interacted and fully cooperated with several agencies including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Inspector General of Police Special Investigation Panel the Department of State Services Presidential Panel on the Recovery of Public Property Senate Committee on Banking and the House of Representatives Ad Hoc Committee on Treasury Single Account. He noted that in each case the bank had satisfactorily explained that it was simply not in a position to remit the money as whole as it had been lent out to various customers by the previous management of the bank. In the course of the process he explained that the bank kept the CBN abreast of all developments in the case by copying to the governor all correspondences with the various agencies. He insisted that the bank had remained open and transparent about the NNPC’s account balances in its custody. To further show transparency in the transaction the acting MD explained that part of the strategy adopted in the payment of the deposit was to remit it to the CBN and then give the apex bank instruction to credit the NNPC. He admonished the committee that the money should not be classified as looted fund. “Permit me to conclude that the money deposited at Skye Bank and Polaris Bank was at no time hidden from any government agency and therefore we do not believe that it should be classified as looted funds at all” Ike added. Corroborating the process leading to the final payment the bank in the June 21 letter explained “Sometime in December 2018 the Federal Government of Nigeria through the now-disbanded Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property instituted a suit Federal Government of Nigeria vs Polaris Bank Limited (FHC\/ABJ\/CS\/1424\/18) against Polaris Bank Limited for the recovery of $223862000 belonging to the NNPC. The bank instructed the law firm of Falana & Falana Chambers to represent it in the suit. “In February 2019 as a demonstration of good faith the bank made a proposal to commence the instalment payment of the sum of $10m  monthly into the NNPC TSA account with the CBN and began doing so immediately. Eventually the Federal Government being satisfied with the bank’s transparent and diligent conduct in remitting the monthly funds without fail entered into Terms of Settlement with the bank for the continued monthly remittances of $10m to the TSA. The Terms of Settlement were filed and adopted as consent judgment by the court on October 10 2019 eight months after remittance commenced by the current management (see attached consent judgment as Annex 3)” Investigations also showed that the initial sum deposited at the time of opening the account in 2012 was about $30m which grew over time with subsequent deposits amounting to $224324.958.75 at the point the CBN intervened in the bank in 2016. Before then however the troubled account had remained relatively active with payments and withdrawals. The acting MD gave further insight on this by disclosing that the interest of the sum kept with the bank since 2012 was duly paid as could be seen from the statement of account submitted to the committee. He said “We are pleased to state that as of today the total sum of $224324.958.75 which was the outstanding balance in the account as of February 2019 has been paid while the figure of $32041010.83 still reflecting in the account statement is the entry yet to be passed to nil off the balance remitted through cash lodgment (see correspondence with CBN in March 19 2021 as annex 9).” Following queries that the NNPC had yet to confirm the receipt of the money paid into the CBN account Ike stated that they were expecting the NNPC to write and confirm payment stressing that Polaris Bank had written to the apex bank to that effect Since March 19 2021. One of the petitioners Tosin Ojomo a lawyer who appeared before the committee had faulted the submissions of Polaris Bank stating that arrests were made before the bank confessed that the money was truly in its custody to which the chairman overruled noting the need to stay on the issue before the panel. The committee in its show of good faith later discharged and acquitted Polaris Bank of allegations and charges in respect of the said NNPC deposit. It however asked the bank to furnish the secretariat with evidence that the bank had fully repaid the money. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Sunday PUNCH observed that the rain which began around 6am in Lagos fell for over three hours causing heavy flooding and slowing down vehicular movements on Wemco Road in the Ogba area of the state. At Amuwo Odofin the situation was the same with areas around the Apple Junction left flooded and residents going to their early morning business made to waddle through the water. In Ogun residents of Shalom Estate Arepo called on the state government to come to their rescue following the flooding of the area after the Saturday downpour. The estate which had continued to endure the challenge for some years saw their homes flooded  and called on the authorities to help end the challenge which had forced many to relocate from the estate. Speaking with Sunday PUNCH the former Chairman of the estate Bode Adefolu pleaded with the state Ministry of Works to come to their rescue. He said “This is the current situation in Shalom Estate. We have water entering people’s homes and the access to the estate is impassable. “This has been going on for over seven years. The initial challenge was the community water flow that passes behind Shalom and some other areas. With the volume there’s a need for proper planning for collecting the water downstream. “The current situation we are having is that the road work is contributing seriously to it (flooding) in that they (contractors) plan to maintain the same waterway with more volume without any environmental impact assessment of the downstream. “This is where government must come to our aid to clear waterways. Since the road is here to stay and water flow must be maintained it means there must be clear waterway to downstream “Some structures on the waterway need to move. They can only be moved by government. Internally the community had appealed to certain individuals with obstructing structures to move their buildings but this had not yielded any result thereby disturbing the easy flow of water making it to find its level always to flood Shalom.”  In Bayelsa a midnight heavy rain resulted in the massive flooding of several parts of the Bayelsa State capital Yenagoa and its environs.  The heavy rain started at 12:15 am on Saturday and lasted for over two hours. It impacted areas such as Edepie Etegwe Opolo-Epie Biogbolo-Epie and Yenizue-Gene. Other areas affected by the downpour include city-centre Ekeki and Amarata Kpansia Okaka Onopa Yenizue-Epie as well as Elebele-AIT Road and Imiringi Road. Some residents in the areas were seen evacuating water from their houses on Saturday while others attempted to clear narrow water channels and unpaved drainages around their neighbourhoods. Our correspondent who visited some affected areas observed that residents were making use of footbridges also known as ‘monkey bridges’ to access their houses.  A resident in the Biogbolo-Epie area and legal practitioner Mr Lawrence Egina described the flooding as terrible saying “As you can see the rain that fell last night has caused heavy flooding and it looks like it will fall again in the night. It is terrible.”  has made movement very difficult around here because some streets have not been constructed while some constructed ones do not have drainage” he said. Another resident who gave her name as Mrs Kuro said the rain flooding would increase the presence of mosquitoes in the environment. The duo called on the state government to tackle the problem of flooding in Yenagoa saying that residents had suffered hardship due to a lack of a network of drainage. Copyright PUNCH.

It also noted that the technical schools would produce the needed trained and skilled manpower in various sectors of the economy adding that because of their importance the Federal Government was poised to give them the necessary support required. The Minister of State for Education Chukwuemeka Nwajuba in company with the Registrar and Chief Executive National Business and Technical Examinations Board Professor Ifeoma Isiugo-Abanihe stated this while monitoring the ongoing NABTEB examination in Lagos State. Asked if the Federal Government was planning to move the examination online in the light of COVID-19 Nwajuba said “Exams at the moment will remain physical because we are moving gradually to online platforms. At the moment we also do not have platforms that are available at all centres. In other words it’s a continuous infrastructure development engagement for the Federal Government. “Whilst we are still at it we will continue with our physical engagement. With nearly 25000 secondary schools around the country it is important that all of them engage so that as we produce manpower they actually become manpower and not just ‘ordinary power.’ Nwajuba expressed satisfaction with the level of development at state-owned technical and business school Government Technical College Lagos wishing that the same development would be replicated across the country. Prof Ifeoma Isiugo-Abanihe expressed pleasure with the conduct of the exam and sufficiency of invigilators saying the same exam was going on simultaneously across the country.

The document which was presented to ISO members during the Market Evaluation Consumption and Statistics Committee meeting at the organisation’s 58th Council Session on June 17 2021 underscores sugar production in key markets across the continent noting regional differences in terms of output and assessing individual countries’ roles as net exporters and importers. The Executive Director ISO José Orive was quoted as saying “The region is well advanced in terms of sugar production overall but several challenges still hinder its full potential. It is not enough to just produce sugar; producers must be able to move it to buyers efficiently. “When all negotiations related to the AfCFTA have concluded we expect greater investment across the continent and a clearer regulatory framework.” OBG’s Managing Director for Africa Karine Loehman argued that while the challenges faced by Africa’s sugar producers should not be underestimated the report pointed to an industry primed for growth on the back of anticipated increased consumption across the continent and higher levels of output in sub-Saharan Africa. Loehman said “Regional demand for sugar is expected to rise in the coming years driven up by Africa’s population growth and drawing a line under declines triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. “With sub-Saharan Africa’s per capita sugar consumption currently standing at around half of the global average the opportunities to help meet increasing domestic needs by boosting production are considerable.”","image_links":"https:\/\/cdn.punchng.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/02194730\/Sugarcane-plantation.jpg","news_authors":"Agency Report ","published_date":"Published 27 June 2021"},
{"id":"1078","headline":"OML 150: Delta communities threaten to evict oil firm","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/oml-150-delta-communities-threaten-to-evict-oil-firm","stories":"The Delta Communities Consultative Forum comprising seven communities have given a 21-day ultimatum to Conoil Producing Limited operators of OML 150 Obodo Field to negotiate with it or risk eviction from the area. The ultimatum was contained in a statement issued by the chairman of the forum Mr Monday Agbeyi on Saturday. The indigenes of the host communities had marched to the Conoil Obodo Field in a peaceful protest bringing all operational activities to a halt. The placards-wielding protesters with various inscriptions vowed not to leave the company’s premises and or allow any worker into the site until Conoil decided to listen to them by initiating an engagement with the Agbeyi-led executive. The communities however commended the Palace of the Olu of Warri for stepping in at the appropriate time by affirming that the Agbeyi-led executive was the only constituted body. The statement read in part “Despite this it is saddening that the management of Conoil Producing Limited still wants to undermine the authority of the Palace of Olu of Warri and the seven host communities of OML 150 by refusing to open discussions with the legally constituted executive of the forum led by Mr Monday Agbeyi. “It beats our imagination that after the peace meeting organised by the Palace of the Olu of Warri on Thursday June 17 2021 which was duly attended by Conoil Producing Limited and the Monday Agbeyi-led executive was duly presented as the right executive to oversee the affairs of the forum the company still maintains its old-fashioned stand. “The impunity has grown to the extent that the management of the company no longer has any iota of regard for the landlord communities the Olu of Warri and the Delta State Government in spite of the various letters written by the trio to ensure dialogue for peaceful coexistence the company seems to be adamant and resort to divide-and-rule strategy.” Copyright PUNCH.

{"id":"1079","headline":"Alleged debt: A’Court orders fresh hearing of winding-up petition against Honeywell","news_link":"https:\/\/punchng.com\/alleged-debt-acourt-orders-fresh-hearing-of-winding-up-petition-against-honeywell","stories":"The Court of Appeal Lagos Division has nullified a June 27 2016 ruling of the Federal High Court in Lagos which struck out a winding-up petition filed by Ecobank Nigeria Limited to recover an alleged debt from Honeywell Group Limited. The appellate court in a lead judgment by Justice Obietonbara Daniel-Kalio ordered the return of the winding-up petition to the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court Justice John Tsoho for re-assignment to a new judge. Justice Daniel-Kalio’s April 1 2021 judgment whose certified true copy was obtained by our correspodent on Friday was consented to by Justices Obande Ogbuinya and Onyakachi Otisi who were other members of the three-man panel. Justice Jude Dagat of the Federal High Court had in 2016 struck out Ecobank’s winding-up petition after upholding the argument by Honeywell’s lawyer Mr Bode Olanipekun (SAN) that the winding-up petition amounted to an abuse of court processes in view of a pending suit marked FHC\/L\/CS\/1219\/2015 which three subsidiaries of Honeywell Group Limited had earlier filed against Ecobank to challenge the bank’s claim that they were indebted. Displeased with Justice Dagat’s decision Ecobank had through its lawyer Mr Kunle Ogunba (SAN) gone on appeal contending that Justice Dagat was wrong to have struck out its winding-up petition against Honeywell Group Limited. Ogunba in the appeal contended that the winding-up petition by Ecobank did not constitute an abuse of court processes because the parties in the winding-up petition were different from the parties in the earlier suit filed by Honeywell Group Limited’s subsidiaries – Anchorage Leisures Limited; Siloam Global Services Limited; and Honeywell Flour Mills Plc. But Honeywell’s lawyer Olanipekun urged the Court of Appeal to dismiss Ecobank’s appeal and uphold Justice Dagat’s decision. However the three-man panel agreed with Ecobank rather than Honeywell and reversed Justice Dagat’s ruling. In the panel’s lead judgment Justice Daniel-Kalio said he found that contrary to Justice Dagat’s decision the parties in the winding-up petition were different from the parties in the earlier suit by Honeywell’s subsidiaries before Justice Mohammed Idris. He said Justice Dagat was wrong to have tagged the winding-up petition as an abuse of court processes and dismiss it. Justice Daniel-Kalio held “The appellant’s petition for winding-up was filed by the appellant Ecobank Nigeria Limited against Honeywell Group. In the matter before Idris J in suit No: FHC\/L\/CS\/1219\/2015 on the other hand the parties were Anchorage Leisures Limited; Siloam Global Limited; and Honeywell Flour Mills Plc. Straightaway the parties are clearly not the same… The ruling of the lower court striking out the petition is wrong as there was no abuse of court processes as there was no multiplicity of suits involving the same parties. “The ruling of the lower court is therefore hereby set aside. It is ordered that the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court shall re-assign the hearing of the appellant’s petition to another judge of the Federal High Court.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
